The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about chemistry:

Question 1: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.

Options: A. 10
B. 8
C. 4
D. 20
E. 12
F. 3
G. 16
H. 5
I. 24
J. 6

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = 
\frac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (B).

Question 2: Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?

Options: A. GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4 < CH4
B. SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < CH4
C. PbH4 < CH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
D. PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
E. SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < PbH4 < CH4
F. CH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4
G. SiH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < CH4
H. CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4
I. CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4
J. PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (J). The answer is (J).

Question 3: Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?

Options: A. H2SO3
B. NaCl
C. CH4
D. HNO3
E. SO2
F. Al(NO3)3
G. CaCO3
H. H2O
I. HCl

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (E).

Question 4: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?

Options: A. 5.78
B. 4.78
C. 4.56
D. 6.89
E. 7.78
F. 3.89
G. 1.23
H. 2.89
I. 2.33
J. 5.33

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $
\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 
\frac{10^{-3.89} \cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (A).

Question 5: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?

Options: A. 0.250 mole
B. 0.500 mole
C. 3.00 mole
D. 1.00 mole
E. 3.50 mole
F. 1.50 mole
G. 2.50 mole
H. 4.00 mole
I. 0.750 mole
J. 2.00 mole

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O 
ightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles. The answer is (J).

To calculate the solubility product constant (Ksp) of lead(II) sulfate (PbSO₄) in water, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Dissociation**: 
   When PbSO₄ dissolves in water, it dissociates into lead ions (Pb²⁺) and sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻):
   \[
   \text{PbSO}_4 (s) \rightleftharpoons \text{Pb}^{2+} (aq) + \text{SO}_4^{2-} (aq)
   \]

2. **Define the Solubility (s)**: 
   Given that the solubility of PbSO₄ at 25°C is \(1.25 \times 10^{-4}\) moles/liter, we denote this concentration as \(s\). Therefore:
   - \([Pb^{2+}] = s = 1.25 \times 10^{-4}\) moles/liter
   - \([SO_4^{2-}] = s = 1.25 \times 10^{-4}\) moles/liter

3. **Write the Expression for Ksp**:
   The solubility product constant (Ksp) is defined as:
   \[
   Ksp = [Pb^{2+}][SO_4^{2-}]
   \]

4. **Substitute the Values**:
   We can substitute the concentrations into the expression to compute Ksp:
   \[
   Ksp = (1.25 \times 10^{-4}) \times (1.25 \times 10^{-4})
   \]
   \[
   Ksp = (1.25 \times 10^{-4})^2
   \]
   \[
   Ksp = 1.5625 \times 10^{-8} \text{ moles}^2/\text{liter}^2
   \]

5. **Scientific Notation**:
   To express \(1.5625 \times 10^{-8}\) in a more standard form, we can round it:
   - \(Ksp ≈ 1.6 \times 10^{-8} \text{ moles}^2/\text{liter}^2\) (to two significant figures).

6. **Match with the Provided Options**:
   Now we look through the options provided:
   - A. \(6.25 \times 10^{-9}\) moles²/liter²
   - B. \(7.8 \times 10^{-8}\) moles²/liter²
   - C. \(1.6 \times 10^{-8}\) moles²/liter²
   - D. \(1.0 \times 10^{-7}\) moles²/liter²
   - E. \(2.5 \times 10^{-8}\) moles²/liter²
   - F. \(5.0 \times 10^{-8}\) moles²/liter²
   - G. \(0.8 \times 10^{-8}\) moles²/liter²
   - H. \(2.0 \times 10^{-9}\) moles²/liter²
   - I. \(3.2 \times 10^{-8}\) moles²/liter²
   - J. \(4.0 \times 10^{-8}\) moles²/liter²

Considering our calculation leads us to \(1.6 \times 10^{-8}\) moles²/liter², which perfectly matches option C.

Therefore, the answer is **The answer is (C)**.

Let's think step by step.  The dissolution of lead(II) sulfate (PbSO₄) in water can be represented by the following equilibrium:

PbSO₄(s) ⇌ Pb²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq)

The solubility product constant, Ksp, is defined as:

Ksp = [Pb²⁺][SO₄²⁻]

We are given that the solubility of PbSO₄ in water is 1.25 × 10⁻⁴ moles/liter.  This means that at equilibrium, the concentration of Pb²⁺ ions is equal to the concentration of SO₄²⁻ ions, both being 1.25 × 10⁻⁴ M (since they are produced in a 1:1 ratio).

Therefore, we can substitute these concentrations into the Ksp expression:

Ksp = (1.25 × 10⁻⁴)(1.25 × 10⁻⁴) = 1.5625 × 10⁻⁸

Rounding to the appropriate significant figures, we get 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ moles²/liter².

Therefore, the answer is (C).

The answer is (C)

Let's think step by step. The solubility product constant (Ksp) for PbSO₄ is defined as:

Ksp = [Pb²⁺][SO₄²⁻]

The solubility of PbSO₄ is given as 1.25 × 10⁻⁴ moles/liter.  Since PbSO₄ dissociates into one Pb²⁺ ion and one SO₄²⁻ ion, the concentrations of both ions at equilibrium are equal to the solubility:

[Pb²⁺] = [SO₄²⁻] = 1.25 × 10⁻⁴ M

Substituting these values into the Ksp expression:

Ksp = (1.25 × 10⁻⁴)(1.25 × 10⁻⁴) = 1.5625 × 10⁻⁸

Rounding to two significant figures, we get 1.6 × 10⁻⁸ moles²/liter².
