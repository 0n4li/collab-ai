The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about chemistry:

Question 1: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.

Options: A. 10
B. 8
C. 4
D. 20
E. 12
F. 3
G. 16
H. 5
I. 24
J. 6

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = 
\frac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (B).

Question 2: Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?

Options: A. GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4 < CH4
B. SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < CH4
C. PbH4 < CH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
D. PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
E. SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < PbH4 < CH4
F. CH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4
G. SiH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < CH4
H. CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4
I. CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4
J. PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (J). The answer is (J).

Question 3: Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?

Options: A. H2SO3
B. NaCl
C. CH4
D. HNO3
E. SO2
F. Al(NO3)3
G. CaCO3
H. H2O
I. HCl

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (E).

Question 4: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?

Options: A. 5.78
B. 4.78
C. 4.56
D. 6.89
E. 7.78
F. 3.89
G. 1.23
H. 2.89
I. 2.33
J. 5.33

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $
\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 
\frac{10^{-3.89} \cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (A).

Question 5: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?

Options: A. 0.250 mole
B. 0.500 mole
C. 3.00 mole
D. 1.00 mole
E. 3.50 mole
F. 1.50 mole
G. 2.50 mole
H. 4.00 mole
I. 0.750 mole
J. 2.00 mole

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O 
ightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles. The answer is (J).

To solve the question regarding the decomposition of NaNO₃ to produce a specific mass of O₂, we need to follow a step-by-step approach involving stoichiometry.

1. **Chemical Equation**: First, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of sodium nitrate:
   
   \[
   2 \text{NaNO}_3 \rightarrow 2 \text{NaNO}_2 + \text{O}_2
   \]

   This equation indicates that 2 moles of sodium nitrate decompose to produce 1 mole of oxygen gas.

2. **Molar Mass Calculation**: Next, we calculate the molar masses of NaNO₃ and O₂:
   - Molar mass of NaNO₃ = Na (23.0 g/mol) + N (14.0 g/mol) + 3 × O (16.0 g/mol) = 23.0 + 14.0 + 48.0 = 85.0 g/mol.
   - Molar mass of O₂ = 2 × O (16.0 g/mol) = 32.0 g/mol.

3. **Calculating Moles of O₂**: We need to find out how many moles of O₂ correspond to 1.50 g:
   
   \[
   \text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{\text{mass of O}_2}{\text{molar mass of O}_2} = \frac{1.50 \text{ g}}{32.0 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.046875 \text{ mol}
   \]

4. **Using Stoichiometry**: According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of O₂ is produced from 2 moles of NaNO₃. Therefore, the moles of NaNO₃ required to produce the calculated moles of O₂ is:
   
   \[
   \text{Moles of NaNO}_3 = 2 \times \text{Moles of O}_2 = 2 \times 0.046875 \text{ mol} \approx 0.09375 \text{ mol}
   \]

5. **Converting Moles to Grams**: Finally, we convert the moles of NaNO₃ back to grams to find out how much sodium nitrate is needed:
   
   \[
   \text{Mass of NaNO}_3 = \text{Moles of NaNO}_3 \times \text{Molar mass of NaNO}_3 = 0.09375 \text{ mol} \times 85.0 \text{ g/mol} \approx 7.96875 \text{ g}
   \]

   Rounding this gives approximately 7.97 g.

6. **Choosing the Correct Answer**: We compare this result with the provided options.

From the options given:
- A. 8.45 g
- B. 10.34 g
- C. 5.00 g
- D. 11.67 g
- E. 6.58 g
- F. 14.29 g
- G. 9.21 g
- H. 4.75 g
- I. 12.04 g
- J. 7.97 g

We see that the closest match is option J.

Therefore, the answer is **The answer is (J)**.

Let's think step by step.  The balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of sodium nitrate (NaNO₃) is:

2NaNO₃ → 2NaNO₂ + O₂

This tells us that for every 2 moles of NaNO₃ decomposed, 1 mole of O₂ is produced.

First, we need to find the number of moles of O₂ in 1.50 g.  The molar mass of O₂ is approximately 32 g/mol (16 g/mol per oxygen atom x 2 atoms).

Moles of O₂ = mass / molar mass = 1.50 g / 32 g/mol ≈ 0.0469 mol

From the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, we know that 2 moles of NaNO₃ produce 1 mole of O₂.  Therefore, the number of moles of NaNO₃ needed is:

Moles of NaNO₃ = 2 * moles of O₂ = 2 * 0.0469 mol ≈ 0.0938 mol

Now we need to convert moles of NaNO₃ to grams. The molar mass of NaNO₃ is approximately 85 g/mol (23 g/mol for Na + 14 g/mol for N + 3*16 g/mol for O).

Mass of NaNO₃ = moles * molar mass = 0.0938 mol * 85 g/mol ≈ 7.97 g

Therefore, approximately 7.97 g of NaNO₃ would need to be decomposed to produce 1.50 g of O₂.

The answer is (J).

To determine how much NaNO₃ is needed to produce 1.50 g of O₂ from its decomposition, we can follow these steps:

1. **Balanced Chemical Equation**:
   The decomposition reaction of sodium nitrate is:
   \[
   2 \text{NaNO}_3 \rightarrow 2 \text{NaNO}_2 + \text{O}_2
   \]
   This shows that 2 moles of NaNO₃ produce 1 mole of O₂.

2. **Calculate Molar Masses**:
   - Molar mass of NaNO₃ is approximately:
     \[
     23.0 \, (\text{Na}) + 14.0 \, (\text{N}) + 3 \times 16.0 \, (\text{O}) = 85.0 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
   - Molar mass of O₂ is:
     \[
     2 \times 16.0 = 32.0 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]

3. **Calculate Moles of O₂**:
   To find the moles of O₂ in 1.50 g:
   \[
   \text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{1.50 \, \text{g}}{32.0 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.046875 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Calculate Moles of NaNO₃ Required**:
   From the balanced equation, the moles of NaNO₃ needed:
   \[
   \text{Moles of NaNO}_3 = 2 \times \text{Moles of O}_2 = 2 \times 0.046875 \approx 0.09375 \, \text{mol}
   \]

5. **Convert Moles to Grams**:
   To find the mass of NaNO₃ required:
   \[
   \text{Mass of NaNO}_3 = \text{Moles of NaNO}_3 \times 85.0 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.09375 \times 85.0 \approx 7.97 \, \text{g}
   \]

After calculating, we find that approximately 7.97 g of NaNO₃ needs to be decomposed to produce 1.50 g of O₂.

**The answer is (J)**.

Let's think step by step. The balanced equation for the decomposition of sodium nitrate is:

2NaNO₃ → 2NaNO₂ + O₂

This shows that 2 moles of NaNO₃ produce 1 mole of O₂.

First, we find the moles of O₂ in 1.50 g.  The molar mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol.

Moles of O₂ = 1.50 g / 32 g/mol ≈ 0.0469 mol

From the stoichiometry, 2 moles of NaNO₃ produce 1 mole of O₂, so we need:

Moles of NaNO₃ = 2 * 0.0469 mol ≈ 0.0938 mol

The molar mass of NaNO₃ is approximately 85 g/mol.  Therefore, the mass of NaNO₃ needed is:

Mass of NaNO₃ = 0.0938 mol * 85 g/mol ≈ 7.97 g

The answer is (J).
