The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about chemistry:

Question 1: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.

Options: A. 10
B. 8
C. 4
D. 20
E. 12
F. 3
G. 16
H. 5
I. 24
J. 6

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = 
\frac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (B).

Question 2: Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?

Options: A. GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4 < CH4
B. SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < CH4
C. PbH4 < CH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
D. PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
E. SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < PbH4 < CH4
F. CH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4
G. SiH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < CH4
H. CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4
I. CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4
J. PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (J). The answer is (J).

Question 3: Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?

Options: A. H2SO3
B. NaCl
C. CH4
D. HNO3
E. SO2
F. Al(NO3)3
G. CaCO3
H. H2O
I. HCl

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (E).

Question 4: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?

Options: A. 5.78
B. 4.78
C. 4.56
D. 6.89
E. 7.78
F. 3.89
G. 1.23
H. 2.89
I. 2.33
J. 5.33

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $
\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 
\frac{10^{-3.89} \cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (A).

Question 5: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?

Options: A. 0.250 mole
B. 0.500 mole
C. 3.00 mole
D. 1.00 mole
E. 3.50 mole
F. 1.50 mole
G. 2.50 mole
H. 4.00 mole
I. 0.750 mole
J. 2.00 mole

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O 
ightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles. The answer is (J).

Sure, let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Given Data:
- Vapor pressure of pure benzene (\(P^0_{benzene}\)) at 60°C: 385 Torr
- Vapor pressure of pure toluene (\(P^0_{toluene}\)) at 60°C: 139 Torr
- Mole fraction of toluene in the solution (\(X_{toluene}\)): 0.60 

### a) Calculate Partial Pressures:

Using Raoult's Law, the partial pressures (\(P_{benzene}\) and \(P_{toluene}\)) can be calculated as:

\[
P_{benzene} = X_{benzene} \cdot P^0_{benzene}
\]
\[
P_{toluene} = X_{toluene} \cdot P^0_{toluene}
\]

First, we calculate the mole fraction of benzene (\(X_{benzene}\)):
\[
X_{benzene} = 1 - X_{toluene} = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40
\]

Now, let's calculate the partial pressures:

1. **For Benzene:**
   \[
   P_{benzene} = 0.40 \cdot 385 = 154.0 \, \text{Torr}
   \]

2. **For Toluene:**
   \[
   P_{toluene} = 0.60 \cdot 139 = 83.4 \, \text{Torr}
   \]

### b) Calculate Total Vapor Pressure (\(P_{total}\)):
The total vapor pressure (\(P_{total}\)) of the solution is the sum of the partial pressures:
\[
P_{total} = P_{benzene} + P_{toluene}
\]
\[
P_{total} = 154.0 + 83.4 = 237.4 \, \text{Torr}
\]

### c) Calculate Mole Fraction of Toluene in the Vapor (\(X_{toluene, vapor}\)):
To find the mole fraction in the vapor phase, we use the formula:
\[
X_{toluene, vapor} = \frac{P_{toluene}}{P_{total}}
\]
\[
X_{toluene, vapor} = \frac{83.4}{237.4} \approx 0.351
\]

### Summary of Calculated Values:
1. \(P_{benzene} = 154.0 \, \text{Torr}\)
2. \(P_{toluene} = 83.4 \, \text{Torr}\)
3. \(P_{total} = 237.4 \, \text{Torr}\)
4. \(X_{toluene, vapor} \approx 0.351\)

### Correct Option:
Based on the calculations:
- The partial pressure of benzene is 154.0 Torr.
- The partial pressure of toluene is 83.4 Torr.
- The total vapor pressure is 237.4 Torr.
- The mole fraction of toluene in the vapor is 0.351.

Looking at the provided options, the closest match is:

**I. P_benzene= 154.0Torr, P_toluene= 83.4Torr, P_total= 237.4Torr, X_toluene,vap= 0.351**

Thus, the answer is:
The answer is (I).

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step using Raoult's Law:

**(a) Partial Pressures of Benzene and Toluene:**

Raoult's Law states that the partial pressure of a component in an ideal solution is equal to the product of its mole fraction in the solution and its vapor pressure in the pure state.

* **Benzene:**  The mole fraction of benzene (X_benzene) is 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 (since X_benzene + X_toluene = 1).  The vapor pressure of pure benzene is given as 385 Torr.

   Therefore, P_benzene = X_benzene * P°_benzene = 0.40 * 385 Torr = 154 Torr

* **Toluene:** The mole fraction of toluene (X_toluene) is given as 0.60. The vapor pressure of pure toluene is given as 139 Torr.

   Therefore, P_toluene = X_toluene * P°_toluene = 0.60 * 139 Torr = 83.4 Torr


**(b) Total Vapor Pressure:**

The total vapor pressure of the solution is the sum of the partial pressures of its components.

P_total = P_benzene + P_toluene = 154 Torr + 83.4 Torr = 237.4 Torr


**(c) Mole Fraction of Toluene in the Vapor:**

The mole fraction of toluene in the vapor phase (X_toluene,vap) is calculated by considering the partial pressure of toluene relative to the total pressure:

X_toluene,vap = P_toluene / P_total = 83.4 Torr / 237.4 Torr ≈ 0.351


**Therefore, the answer is (I).**

The answer is (I)

Let's analyze the question step by step.

### Given Data:
- Vapor pressure of pure benzene at 60°C: 385 Torr 
- Vapor pressure of pure toluene at 60°C: 139 Torr 
- Mole fraction of toluene in the solution: 0.60 

### (a) Calculate Partial Pressures:

Using Raoult's Law, the partial pressures can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the mole fraction of benzene:
   \[
   X_{benzene} = 1 - X_{toluene} = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40
   \]

2. Calculate the partial pressures:
   - For benzene:
   \[
   P_{benzene} = X_{benzene} \cdot P^0_{benzene} = 0.40 \cdot 385 = 154.0 \, \text{Torr}
   \]

   - For toluene:
   \[
   P_{toluene} = X_{toluene} \cdot P^0_{toluene} = 0.60 \cdot 139 = 83.4 \, \text{Torr}
   \]

### (b) Calculate Total Vapor Pressure:
The total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:
\[
P_{total} = P_{benzene} + P_{toluene} = 154.0 + 83.4 = 237.4 \, \text{Torr}
\]

### (c) Calculate Mole Fraction of Toluene in the Vapor:
To find the mole fraction of toluene in the vapor, the formula is:
\[
X_{toluene, vapor} = \frac{P_{toluene}}{P_{total}} = \frac{83.4}{237.4} \approx 0.351
\]

### Summary of Calculated Values:
1. \(P_{benzene} = 154.0 \, \text{Torr}\)
2. \(P_{toluene} = 83.4 \, \text{Torr}\)
3. \(P_{total} = 237.4 \, \text{Torr}\)
4. \(X_{toluene, vapor} \approx 0.351\)

Upon reviewing the options provided, the closest match to our calculations is:

**I. P_benzene= 154.0Torr, P_toluene= 83.4Torr, P_total= 237.4Torr, X_toluene,vap= 0.351**

The answer is (I).

Let's think step by step.  We'll use Raoult's Law to solve this problem. Raoult's Law states that the partial pressure of a component in an ideal solution is equal to the product of its mole fraction in the solution and its vapor pressure in the pure state.

**(a) Partial Pressures:**

* **Benzene:** The mole fraction of benzene (X<sub>benzene</sub>) is 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.  The vapor pressure of pure benzene is 385 Torr.  Therefore, P<sub>benzene</sub> = 0.40 * 385 Torr = 154 Torr.

* **Toluene:** The mole fraction of toluene (X<sub>toluene</sub>) is 0.60. The vapor pressure of pure toluene is 139 Torr. Therefore, P<sub>toluene</sub> = 0.60 * 139 Torr = 83.4 Torr.

**(b) Total Vapor Pressure:**

P<sub>total</sub> = P<sub>benzene</sub> + P<sub>toluene</sub> = 154 Torr + 83.4 Torr = 237.4 Torr

**(c) Mole Fraction of Toluene in the Vapor:**

X<sub>toluene,vap</sub> = P<sub>toluene</sub> / P<sub>total</sub> = 83.4 Torr / 237.4 Torr ≈ 0.351

Therefore, the partial pressure of benzene is 154.0 Torr, the partial pressure of toluene is 83.4 Torr, the total vapor pressure is 237.4 Torr, and the mole fraction of toluene in the vapor is 0.351.

The answer is (I)
