The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about chemistry:

Question 1: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.

Options: A. 10
B. 8
C. 4
D. 20
E. 12
F. 3
G. 16
H. 5
I. 24
J. 6

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = 
\frac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (B).

Question 2: Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?

Options: A. GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4 < CH4
B. SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < CH4
C. PbH4 < CH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
D. PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
E. SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < PbH4 < CH4
F. CH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4
G. SiH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < CH4
H. CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4
I. CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4
J. PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (J). The answer is (J).

Question 3: Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?

Options: A. H2SO3
B. NaCl
C. CH4
D. HNO3
E. SO2
F. Al(NO3)3
G. CaCO3
H. H2O
I. HCl

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (E).

Question 4: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?

Options: A. 5.78
B. 4.78
C. 4.56
D. 6.89
E. 7.78
F. 3.89
G. 1.23
H. 2.89
I. 2.33
J. 5.33

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $
\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 
\frac{10^{-3.89} \cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (A).

Question 5: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?

Options: A. 0.250 mole
B. 0.500 mole
C. 3.00 mole
D. 1.00 mole
E. 3.50 mole
F. 1.50 mole
G. 2.50 mole
H. 4.00 mole
I. 0.750 mole
J. 2.00 mole

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O 
ightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles. The answer is (J).

To determine the final pressure in the wine bottle after all the Dry Ice (CO₂) has evaporated, we can use the Ideal Gas Law, which is given by the formula:

\[ PV = nRT \]

Where:
- \( P \) = pressure (in atm)
- \( V \) = volume (in liters)
- \( n \) = number of moles of gas
- \( R \) = ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol))
- \( T \) = temperature (in Kelvin)

**Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of CO₂.**

We need to first determine how many moles of CO₂ are in the 20 g chunk. The molar mass of CO₂ is:
- Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol
- Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol → 2 O = 32.00 g/mol
- Therefore, the molar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 g + 32.00 g = 44.01 g/mol.

Now, to determine the number of moles (\( n \)):
\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{20 \text{ g}}{44.01 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.4545 \text{ moles}
\]

**Step 2: Convert the temperature to Kelvin.**

The given temperature is 25°C. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, we use the formula:
\[
T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15 = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K
\]

**Step 3: Use the Ideal Gas Law to find the pressure.**

We now can plug the values into the Ideal Gas Law. The volume (\( V \)) is given as 0.75 liters.

\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V}
\]

Substituting in the values:
- \( n \approx 0.4545 \) moles,
- \( R = 0.0821 \) L·atm/(K·mol),
- \( T = 298.15 K \),
- \( V = 0.75 L \).

Calculating:
\[
P = \frac{0.4545 \text{ mol} \times 0.0821 \text{ L·atm/(K·mol)} \times 298.15 \text{ K}}{0.75 \text{ L}}
\]
\[
P \approx \frac{11.1363}{0.75} \approx 14.82 \text{ atm}
\]

**Step 4: Rounding and determining the Final Answer.**

Rounding 14.82 atm gives us approximately 14.81 atm.

Based on the calculations, the final pressure in the wine bottle after all the CO₂ has evaporated at 25°C is:

The answer is (A).

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Convert grams of CO₂ to moles:**

* First, we need the molar mass of CO₂.  Carbon (C) has a molar mass of approximately 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen (O) has a molar mass of approximately 16.00 g/mol.  Therefore, the molar mass of CO₂ is 12.01 + (2 * 16.00) = 44.01 g/mol.
* We have 20 g of CO₂.  To find the number of moles, we divide the mass by the molar mass:  20 g / 44.01 g/mol ≈ 0.454 moles of CO₂.

**2. Use the Ideal Gas Law:**

* The Ideal Gas Law is PV = nRT, where:
    * P = pressure (what we want to find)
    * V = volume = 0.75 L
    * n = number of moles = 0.454 moles
    * R = ideal gas constant = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K (we're using this unit because we want the pressure in atmospheres)
    * T = temperature in Kelvin = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

**3. Solve for Pressure (P):**

* Rearrange the Ideal Gas Law to solve for P:  P = nRT / V
* Substitute the values: P = (0.454 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298.15 K) / 0.75 L
* Calculate: P ≈ 14.81 atm

Therefore, the final pressure in the bottle after all the CO₂ has evaporated and the temperature has reached 25°C would be approximately 14.81 atm.

The answer is (A)

To determine the final pressure in the wine bottle after all the Dry Ice (CO₂) has evaporated at 25°C, we can use the Ideal Gas Law, given by the formula:

\[ PV = nRT \]

Where:
- \( P \) = pressure (in atm)
- \( V \) = volume (in liters) = 0.75 L
- \( n \) = number of moles of gas
- \( R \) = ideal gas constant = 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol)
- \( T \) = temperature (in Kelvin) = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

**Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of CO₂.**
The molar mass of CO₂ is calculated as follows:
- Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol
- Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol → \(2 \times 16.00 = 32.00\) g/mol
- Therefore, the molar mass of CO₂ is \( 12.01 + 32.00 = 44.01 \) g/mol.

Now, we determine the number of moles (\( n \)):
\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{20 \text{ g}}{44.01 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.4545 \text{ moles}
\]

**Step 2: Use the Ideal Gas Law to find the pressure.**

Using the Ideal Gas Law:
\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P = \frac{0.4545 \text{ mol} \times 0.0821 \text{ L·atm/(K·mol)} \times 298.15 \text{ K}}{0.75 \text{ L}}
\]

Calculating:
\[
P = \frac{11.1363}{0.75} \approx 14.81 \text{ atm}
\]

Thus, the final pressure in the wine bottle after all the CO₂ has evaporated and the temperature has reached 25°C is approximately 14.81 atm.

The answer is (A).

To determine the final pressure, we use the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT).

First, we calculate the number of moles of CO₂:

* Molar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16.00 g/mol (O) = 44.01 g/mol
* Moles of CO₂ = 20 g / 44.01 g/mol ≈ 0.454 moles

Next, we convert the temperature to Kelvin: 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

Now, we can solve for pressure (P):

P = nRT / V = (0.454 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298.15 K) / 0.75 L ≈ 14.81 atm

The final pressure in the bottle is approximately 14.81 atm.

The answer is (A)
