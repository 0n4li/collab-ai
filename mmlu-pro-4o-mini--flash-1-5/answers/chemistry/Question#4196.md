The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about chemistry:

Question 1: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.

Options: A. 10
B. 8
C. 4
D. 20
E. 12
F. 3
G. 16
H. 5
I. 24
J. 6

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = 
\frac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (B).

Question 2: Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?

Options: A. GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4 < CH4
B. SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < CH4
C. PbH4 < CH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
D. PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
E. SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < PbH4 < CH4
F. CH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4
G. SiH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < CH4
H. CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4
I. CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4
J. PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (J). The answer is (J).

Question 3: Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?

Options: A. H2SO3
B. NaCl
C. CH4
D. HNO3
E. SO2
F. Al(NO3)3
G. CaCO3
H. H2O
I. HCl

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (E).

Question 4: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?

Options: A. 5.78
B. 4.78
C. 4.56
D. 6.89
E. 7.78
F. 3.89
G. 1.23
H. 2.89
I. 2.33
J. 5.33

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $
\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 
\frac{10^{-3.89} \cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (A).

Question 5: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?

Options: A. 0.250 mole
B. 0.500 mole
C. 3.00 mole
D. 1.00 mole
E. 3.50 mole
F. 1.50 mole
G. 2.50 mole
H. 4.00 mole
I. 0.750 mole
J. 2.00 mole

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O 
ightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles. The answer is (J).

To solve this question step by step, we will follow the stoichiometry of the reaction and the gas laws to find the volume of oxygen produced.

### Step 1: Determine the moles of KClO₃ used
First, we need to calculate the number of moles of potassium chlorate (KClO₃) that we started with. The molar mass of KClO₃ is calculated as follows:

- Potassium (K): 39.10 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 3 × 16.00 g/mol = 48.00 g/mol

Therefore,  
Molar mass of KClO₃ = 39.10 + 35.45 + 48.00 = 122.55 g/mol

Now, we will calculate the moles of KClO₃ in 1.28 g:

\[
\text{moles of KClO₃} = \frac{1.28 \, \text{g}}{122.55 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.01044 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 2: Use stoichiometry to find moles of O₂ produced
From the balanced chemical equation:

\[
2 \, \text{KClO₃} \rightarrow 2 \, \text{KCl} + 3 \, \text{O₂}
\]

This tells us that 2 moles of KClO₃ produce 3 moles of O₂. Thus, we can find the amount of O₂ produced from the moles of KClO₃ used:

\[
\text{moles of O₂} = \left( \frac{3 \, \text{moles O₂}}{2 \, \text{moles KClO₃}} \right) \times 0.01044 \, \text{moles KClO₃} \approx 0.01566 \, \text{moles of O₂}
\]

### Step 3: Adjust the pressure for water vapor
The next step is to use the ideal gas law, adjusting for the pressure of water vapor. The total pressure measured is given as 753 mm Hg, and we know the vapor pressure of water at 20 °C is 17.5 mm Hg:

\[
\text{Pressure of O₂} = \text{Total Pressure} - \text{Pressure of Water Vapor} = 753 \, \text{mm Hg} - 17.5 \, \text{mm Hg} = 735.5 \, \text{mm Hg}
\]

### Step 4: Convert pressure to atmospheres
To use the ideal gas law, we need to convert this pressure from mm Hg to atm:

\[
\text{Pressure in atm} = \frac{735.5 \, \text{mm Hg}}{760 \, \text{mm Hg/atm}} \approx 0.968 atm
\]

### Step 5: Use the ideal gas law to find the volume of O₂ produced
The ideal gas law is defined as:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

Where: 
- \(P\) = pressure in atm (0.968 atm)
- \(V\) = volume in liters
- \(n\) = moles of O₂ (0.01566 moles)
- \(R\) = ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol))
- \(T\) = temperature in Kelvin (20 °C = 293.15 K)

Rearranging the ideal gas law to solve for \(V\):

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{0.01566 \times 0.0821 \times 293.15}{0.968}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
V \approx \frac{0.38267}{0.968} \approx 0.394 L
\]

### Step 6: Convert volume to milliliters
Now, converting the volume from liters to milliliters:

\[
V = 0.394 \, \text{L} = 394 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the final volume of oxygen gas produced is approximately 394 mL. Looking at the options provided, the closest available option is:

The answer is (C) 390 ml.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the moles of KClO₃:**

* The molar mass of KClO₃ is approximately 39.1 (K) + 35.5 (Cl) + 3 * 16 (O) = 122.6 g/mol.
* Moles of KClO₃ = mass / molar mass = 1.28 g / 122.6 g/mol = 0.0104 moles

**2. Calculate the moles of O₂ produced:**

* From the balanced equation, 2 moles of KClO₃ produce 3 moles of O₂.
* Moles of O₂ = (0.0104 moles KClO₃) * (3 moles O₂ / 2 moles KClO₃) = 0.0156 moles O₂

**3. Correct the pressure of O₂ for water vapor:**

* The total pressure is 753 mm Hg.
* The water vapor pressure is 17.5 mm Hg.
* The partial pressure of O₂ is 753 mm Hg - 17.5 mm Hg = 735.5 mm Hg

**4. Convert pressure to atmospheres:**

* 1 atm = 760 mm Hg
* Pressure of O₂ in atm = 735.5 mm Hg * (1 atm / 760 mm Hg) = 0.968 atm

**5. Convert temperature to Kelvin:**

* Temperature = 20°C + 273.15 = 293.15 K

**6. Use the Ideal Gas Law to calculate the volume of O₂:**

* PV = nRT
* V = nRT / P
* V = (0.0156 moles) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (293.15 K) / (0.968 atm) 
* V ≈ 0.389 L

**7. Convert volume to milliliters:**

* Volume = 0.389 L * 1000 mL/L = 389 mL

The closest answer is 390 mL.

The answer is (C)

To determine the volume of oxygen gas produced from the decomposition of potassium chlorate (KClO₃), we will follow a step-by-step approach based on stoichiometry and the ideal gas law.

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of KClO₃
First, we calculate the number of moles of potassium chlorate (KClO₃) used in the reaction. The molar mass of KClO₃ is approximately:

- Potassium (K): 39.10 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 3 × 16.00 g/mol = 48.00 g/mol

Thus, the total molar mass of KClO₃:
\[
\text{Molar mass of KClO₃} = 39.10 + 35.45 + 48.00 = 122.55 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Calculating the moles in 1.28 g of KClO₃:
\[
\text{Moles of KClO₃} = \frac{1.28 \, \text{g}}{122.55 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.01044 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 2: Use stoichiometry to find moles of O₂ produced
From the balanced equation:
\[
2 \, \text{KClO₃} \rightarrow 2 \, \text{KCl} + 3 \, \text{O₂}
\]
This means that 2 moles of KClO₃ produce 3 moles of O₂. Therefore:
\[
\text{Moles of O₂} = \left( \frac{3 \, \text{moles O₂}}{2 \, \text{moles KClO₃}} \right) \times 0.01044 \, \text{moles} \approx 0.01566 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 3: Adjust the pressure for water vapor
The observed pressure of the gas collected is 753 mm Hg, and the pressure of water vapor at 20°C is 17.5 mm Hg. Thus, the partial pressure of O₂:
\[
\text{Pressure of O₂} = 753 \, \text{mm Hg} - 17.5 \, \text{mm Hg} = 735.5 \, \text{mm Hg}
\]

### Step 4: Convert pressure to atmospheres
To convert from mm Hg to atm:
\[
\text{Pressure in atm} = \frac{735.5 \, \text{mm Hg}}{760 \, \text{mm Hg/atm}} \approx 0.968 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 5: Use the ideal gas law to find the volume of O₂ produced
Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \):
\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]
Where:
- \( n = 0.01566 \, \text{moles} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(K·mol)} \)
- Convert temperature: \( 20°C = 293.15 \, \text{K} \)

Substituting the values:
\[
V = \frac{0.01566 \times 0.0821 \times 293.15}{0.968}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
V \approx 0.394 \, \text{L} \equiv 394 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Conclusion
The final volume of oxygen gas produced is approximately 394 mL. Given the options provided, the closest answer is:

The answer is (C) 390 ml.
