Let's think through this question step by step to analyze each option effectively:

1. **Option A: Developed a universal vaccine for all types of flu**  
   - While there have been efforts to create a universal flu vaccine, as of now, such a vaccine has not been successfully developed and widely implemented. Current vaccines target specific strains of the flu virus each year.

2. **Option B: Eradicated polio**  
   - Polio has not been completely eradicated, but significant progress has been made. In many countries, polio has been eliminated, and vaccination campaigns are ongoing to drive it to global eradication. Thus, this is partially true but not fully accurate yet.

3. **Option C: Created a vaccine for the common cold**  
   - There is currently no vaccine for the common cold due to its various causes and the complexity of the viruses involved. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: Found a cure for all types of cancer**  
   - As of now, there is no single cure for all types of cancer. There are treatments available for many types, but this option is broad and incorrect.

5. **Option E: Eradicated smallpox**  
   - This statement is true. Smallpox has been completely eradicated through global vaccination efforts, established in 1980 by the World Health Organization.

6. **Option F: Completely stopped the spread of all infectious diseases**  
   - This is incorrect. Infectious diseases continue to spread globally, albeit at varying rates due to vaccination and other public health measures. Complete cessation has not been achieved.

7. **Option G: Developed immunity to all types of viruses**  
   - This option is incorrect because we have not developed immunity to all viruses, and new viruses continue to emerge.

8. **Option H: Eradicated HIV/AIDS**  
   - This is untrue; while treatment has improved with antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV/AIDS has not been eradicated.

After evaluating all of these options, the most accurate statement we can derive is **Option E**, which accurately conveys that we have successfully eradicated smallpox through vaccination efforts. 

Therefore, **The answer is (E)**.

Let's think step by step. The question asks what significant change in the world has been driven by viruses.  Let's examine each option:

A. **Developed a universal vaccine for all types of flu:** This is incorrect.  While flu vaccines exist, they are not universal and require annual updates due to the virus's constant mutation.

B. **Eradicated polio:** While polio has been largely eradicated through vaccination efforts, it is not completely gone globally.  The fight against polio is ongoing, demonstrating the challenge posed by viruses.

C. **Created a vaccine for the common cold:**  There is no effective vaccine for the common cold because it's caused by many different viruses that mutate frequently.

D. **Found a cure for all types of cancer:** Cancer is a complex group of diseases not solely caused by viruses.  There is no single cure for all cancers.

E. **Eradicated smallpox:** This is the correct answer. Smallpox was eradicated through a massive global vaccination campaign.  This is a significant achievement directly attributable to the human response to a virus.  The eradication of smallpox demonstrates the potential impact of concerted global health initiatives in response to viral threats.

F. **Completely stopped the spread of all infectious diseases:**  This is far from true. Many infectious diseases, both viral and bacterial, remain significant health challenges globally.

G. **Developed immunity to all types of viruses:**  Humans do not have immunity to all types of viruses.  Our immune systems fight different viruses, but our susceptibility to novel or mutated viruses remains.

H. **Eradicated HIV/AIDS:**  While treatments for HIV greatly improve quality of life and life expectancy, there is no cure or eradication of HIV/AIDS.

Therefore, the only option reflecting a significant world change directly resulting from viral outbreaks and subsequent human response is the eradication of smallpox.

The answer is (E)
