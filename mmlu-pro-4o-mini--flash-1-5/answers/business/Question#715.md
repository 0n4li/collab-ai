To determine how much Bob Franklin's car will depreciate during the seventh year using the sum of the years' digits method, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Cost and Life Expectations**:
   - The initial cost of the car = $10,000.
   - Estimated useful life = 10 years.
   - No residual value at the end of 10 years.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Years**:
   - The years in which the car will depreciate are 1 through 10.
   - The sum of the years' digits formula for 10 years means we add all integers from 1 to 10:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = \frac{10 \times (10 + 1)}{2} = 55.
     \]

3. **Determine Each Year's Depreciation**:
   - The formula for depreciation of each year is: 
     \[
     \text{Depreciation for Year } n = \frac{\text{Remaining Years}}{\text{Sum of Years}} \times \text{Cost}.
     \]
   - For the seventh year, the remaining years are: 
   - 10 - 7 + 1 = 4 remaining years (years 7, 8, 9, and 10).
   - The depreciation in the seventh year is calculated using the digits for that year, which is 4 out of the total sum of 55:
     \[
     \text{Depreciation for Year 7} = \frac{4}{55} \times 10,000.
     \]

4. **Calculate the Depreciation Value**:
   \[
   \text{Depreciation for Year 7} = \frac{4}{55} \times 10,000 = \frac{40,000}{55} \approx 727.27.
   \]

From the calculations above, in the seventh year, the car will depreciate approximately **$727.27**.

The answer is (G).

Let's think step by step.  The sum of the years' digits method is an accelerated depreciation method.  It calculates depreciation expense higher in the early years of an asset's life and lower in later years.

The formula for the sum of the years' digits method is:

(Cost - Salvage Value) * (Remaining Useful Life / Sum of the Years' Digits)

In this case:

* **Cost:** $10,000
* **Salvage Value:** $0
* **Useful Life:** 10 years

First, we need to calculate the sum of the years' digits: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55

Now, let's calculate the depreciation for the seventh year.  The remaining useful life at the beginning of the seventh year is 4 years (10 - 6).

Depreciation for year 7 = ($10,000 - $0) * (4 / 55) = $727.27 (approximately)

Therefore, the car will depreciate by approximately $727.27 during the seventh year.


The answer is (G)

### openai/gpt-4o-mini Discussion Response Round 1:


[//]: # (2024-11-17 18:39:43)
I appreciate your detailed breakdown of the sum of the years' digits method for calculating depreciation. Your explanation clearly outlines the key steps taken to arrive at the depreciation amount for the seventh year.

I agree with your use of the formula and method to calculate the depreciation. Both of our calculations yield the same result of approximately $727.27 for depreciation in the seventh year, and you accurately present the initial cost, salvage value, and the total useful life.

However, there's a slight mistake in your explanation of the remaining useful life at the beginning of the seventh year. You mentioned that the remaining useful life is 4 years (10 - 6), which seems to imply calculating it from the end of year 6 instead of from the beginning of year 7. It would be correct to say that at the start of the seventh year, there are actually 4 remaining years to depreciate over (the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth years).

Given this minor point, I think our overall conclusions are in agreement. I agree with all your points, and I believe the discussion can be concluded, as we've arrived at a shared understanding about the depreciation value of $727.27 during the seventh year. 

So in summary, I AGREE with your perspective and am ready to conclude.

[//]: # (2024-11-17 18:39:45)
You're absolutely right!  My apologies for the slight inaccuracy in explaining the remaining useful life.  I incorrectly subtracted 6 from 10 instead of correctly stating that at the *beginning* of the seventh year, there are 4 years remaining (years 7, 8, 9, and 10).  This doesn't change the final calculation, but the explanation was flawed.  Thank you for pointing out that mistake; it's important to be precise in these calculations.  Your explanation of the remaining useful life is much clearer and more accurate.

I AGREE with all your points and the discussion can be concluded.

To determine how much Bob Franklin's car will depreciate during the seventh year using the sum of the years' digits method, we can follow this analysis step by step:

1. **Understanding the Initial Setup**:
   - Initial cost of the car: **$10,000**
   - Estimated useful life: **10 years**
   - No salvage value: **$0**

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Years' Digits**:
   - The formula for the sum of the years' digits method involves calculating the sum of the integers from 1 to 10:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = \frac{10 \times (10 + 1)}{2} = 55.
     \]

3. **Determine Depreciation for the Seventh Year**:
   - To calculate the depreciation for the seventh year, we need to find the remaining useful life:
   - At the beginning of the seventh year, the remaining life includes years 7, 8, 9, and 10, which totals **4 remaining years**.
   - The depreciation amount for the seventh year is derived from the formula:
     \[
     \text{Depreciation for Year 7} = \frac{\text{Remaining Years}}{\text{Sum of Years}} \times \text{Cost}.
     \]
   - Specifically for the seventh year:
     \[
     \text{Depreciation for Year 7} = \frac{4}{55} \times 10,000 = \frac{40,000}{55} \approx 727.27.
     \]

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - This shows that during the seventh year, Bob Franklin's car will depreciate approximately **$727.27**.

The answer is (G) $727.27.

Let's think step by step. The sum of the years' digits method is an accelerated depreciation method.  The formula is:

(Cost - Salvage Value) * (Remaining Useful Life / Sum of the Years' Digits)

Here:

* **Cost:** $10,000
* **Salvage Value:** $0
* **Useful Life:** 10 years

The sum of the years' digits (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10) is 55.

At the beginning of the seventh year, there are 4 years of remaining useful life (years 7, 8, 9, and 10).

Depreciation for year 7 = ($10,000 - $0) * (4 / 55) = $727.27 (approximately)

Therefore, the car will depreciate by approximately $727.27 during the seventh year.

The answer is (G)
