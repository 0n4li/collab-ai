Let's break down the question step by step to calculate how much Mr. Golden pays in real estate taxes.

1. **Market Value of the Property**: Mr. Golden's property has a market value of $16,500.

2. **Assessed Valuation**: The assessed valuation is 40% of the actual market value. We can calculate this by multiplying the market value by 40%.
   \[
   \text{Assessed Valuation} = 16,500 \times 0.40 = 6,600
   \]

3. **Tax Rate**: The tax rate given is 21.3 mills per dollar. Since one mill represents one-tenth of a cent, we can convert mills to a decimal to calculate the tax amount. 
   \[
   \text{Tax Rate in Decimal} = \frac{21.3}{1000} = 0.0213
   \]

4. **Calculate Real Estate Taxes**: Now, we can calculate the real estate taxes by multiplying the assessed valuation by the tax rate in decimal form.
   \[
   \text{Real Estate Taxes} = \text{Assessed Valuation} \times \text{Tax Rate in Decimal} = 6,600 \times 0.0213
   \]
   \[
   \text{Real Estate Taxes} = 140.58
   \]

5. **Select the Correct Answer**: The calculation results in $140.58, which corresponds to Option H.

The answer is (H).

[//]: # (2024-11-17 18:36:37)
Okay, let's break down this real estate tax calculation step-by-step.

**Step 1: Calculate the assessed valuation.**

The problem states that the assessed valuation is 40% of the market value.  Therefore:

Assessed Valuation = 0.40 * $16,500 = $6,600

**Step 2: Convert the tax rate from mills to a decimal.**

A mill is 1/1000 of a dollar, so 21.3 mills is equal to 0.0213 in decimal form.

**Step 3: Calculate the real estate taxes.**

To find the tax amount, multiply the assessed valuation by the tax rate:

Real Estate Taxes = $6,600 * 0.0213 = $140.58

Therefore, Mr. Golden pays $140.58 in real estate taxes.

**The answer is (H)**

2. **Tax Rate Conversion**: Your conversion of the tax rate from mills to a decimal form (21.3 mills to 0.0213) is accurate. This conversion is essential, as it allows us to compute the tax in a standard monetary format.

3. **Real Estate Taxes Calculation**: Finally, your calculation of the real estate taxes as $140.58 is spot-on, following the correct formula of multiplying the assessed valuation by the tax rate.

Overall, I must say that you've presented the information clearly and correctly, leading to the conclusion that Mr. Golden pays $140.58 in real estate taxes, corresponding to Option H.

To determine how much Mr. Golden pays in real estate taxes, letâ€™s break down the calculation step by step:

1. **Market Value of the Property**: Mr. Golden's property is valued at $16,500.

2. **Assessed Valuation**: The property is assessed at 40% of its market value.
   \[
   \text{Assessed Valuation} = \text{Market Value} \times 0.40 = 16,500 \times 0.40 = 6,600
   \]

3. **Tax Rate**: The tax rate is given as 21.3 mills per dollar. In decimal form, this translates to:
   \[
   \text{Tax Rate in Decimal} = \frac{21.3}{1000} = 0.0213
   \]

4. **Calculate Real Estate Taxes**: Now we can calculate the real estate tax by multiplying the assessed valuation by the tax rate in decimal form:
   \[
   \text{Real Estate Taxes} = \text{Assessed Valuation} \times \text{Tax Rate in Decimal} = 6,600 \times 0.0213 = 140.58
   \]

Thus, Mr. Golden's real estate taxes amount to $140.58, which corresponds to option H.

The final conclusion is: 

The answer is (H).
