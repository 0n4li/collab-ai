The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about math:

Question 1: The symmetric group $S_n$ has $
\factorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.
Find the characteristic of the ring 2Z.

Options: A. 0
B. 30
C. 3
D. 10
E. 12
F. 50
G. 2
H. 100
I. 20
J. 5

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).

Question 2: Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?

Options: A. ST + TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
B. TS = 0
C. ST = 1
D. ST - TS = 0
E. ST = T
F. ST = 0
G. ST = TS
H. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
I. TS = T
J. ST = S

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. For a given polynomial $p$ we have
\[ST(p) = (xp(x))’ = p(x) + xp’(x)\]
and
\[TS(p) = xp’(x).\]
Hence \[ST(p) - TS(p) = p(x) + xp’(x) - xp’(x).\] The answer is (H).

Question 3: Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \in A}?

Options: A. -5
B. 0
C. -3
D. -7
E. -4
F. -6
G. -1
H. -2
I. -9

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$. The answer is (E).

Question 4: A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?

Options: A. 3 + e^-2
B. 2 - e^-4
C. 2 - e^-2
D. 3 + e^-4
E. 2 + e^-3
F. 2 - e^-3
G. 3 - e^-2
H. 2 + e^-2
I. 2 + e^-4
J. 2

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$
\frac{d}{d t}[\ln (s-2)]=\frac{s^{\prime}}{s-2}=\frac{-1}{25}=\frac{d}{d t}\left[-\frac{t}{25}ight] .
$$
Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$. The answer is (I).

Question 5: A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?

Options: A. Multiply 5 by 5 to find 25 teams.
B. Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.
C. Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.
D. Subtract 30 from 5 to find -25 teams.
E. Divide 5 by 30 to find 0.1667 teams.
F. Add 5 to 30 then divide by 2 to find 17.5 teams.

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We want to find the number of teams. We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players. Thus to get the number of teams we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6 teams. The answer is (B).

To find the total distance Gabriella, the Human Cannonball, flew during her four shows, we need to sum up the individual distances from each of her performances. The distances measured are:

1. 7.04 meters
2. 18.81 meters
3. 18.39 meters
4. 19.94 meters

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. **Adding the first two distances**:
   - \( 7.04 + 18.81 = 25.85 \) meters

2. **Adding the third distance**:
   - \( 25.85 + 18.39 = 44.24 \) meters

3. **Adding the fourth distance**:
   - \( 44.24 + 19.94 = 64.18 \) meters

Now that we have computed the total distance, we find that Gabriella flew a total of **64.18 meters** on that day.

Next, I will compare this result with the answer options provided:
- A. 60.18 m
- B. 70.18 m
- C. 62.18 m
- D. 57.14 m
- E. 74.18 m
- F. 66.18 m
- G. 72.18 m
- H. 64.18 m
- I. 59.24 m
- J. 68.18 m

The correct option matches our computed total distance of **64.18 meters**.

Therefore, the answer is (H).
