The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about engineering:

Question 1: A point pole has a strength of 4π * 10^-4 weber. The force in newtons on a point pole of 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber placed at a distance of 10 cm from it will be

Options: 
A. 25 N.
B. 12.5 N.
C. 15 N.
D. 10 N.
E. 7.5 N.
F. 20 N.
G. 5 N.
H. 3.75 N.

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The force between two point poles is given by m_1m_2/(mu_0 4 \pi r^2), in analogy to Coulomb’s law. Plugging in the values given in the question, we calculate that the force is approximately 15 N. The answer is (C).

Question 2: The coil of a moving coil meter has 100 turns, is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. The control torque is 240*10-6 N-m on full scale. If magnetic flux density is 1Wb/m2 range of meter is

Options: 
A. 2 mA.
B. 5 mA.
C. 1.5 mA.
D. 0.5 mA.
E. 6 mA.
F. 4 mA.
G. 3 mA.
H. 1 mA.
I. 2.5 mA.
J. 3.5 mA.

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. The torque on a coil in a uniform magnetic field is given by BANI, where B is the magnetic flux density, A is the area of the coil, N is the number of turns, and I is the current. So we have that I = (Torque)/(BAN), or 240e-6/(1200e-6 * 100 * 1) = 2e-3. The answer is (A).

Question 3: In an SR latch built from NOR gates, which condition is not allowed

Options: 
A. S=0, R=2
B. S=2, R=2
C. S=1, R=1
D. S=1, R=-1
E. S=1, R=2
F. S=0, R=0
G. S=2, R=0
H. S=1, R=0
I. S=2, R=1
J. S=0, R=1

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. An SR latch is a set-reset latch; in the case where S=1 and R=1, the circuit has no stable state; instead a race condition will be produced within the circuit, so the device will be in an undefined state. So S=1, R=1 is an illegal input. The answer is (C).

Question 4: Two long parallel conductors carry 100 A. If the conductors are separated by 20 mm, the force per meter of length of each conductor will be

Options: 
A. 100 N.
B. 0.01 N.
C. 10 N.
D. 0.5 N.
E. 0.001 N.
F. 5 N.
G. 1 N.
H. 50 N.
I. 0.1 N.
J. 0.0001 N.

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. The magnetic force-per-length between two current-carrying conductors is given by \mu_0 I_1 I_2 / (2 \pi r), where $r$ is the separation distance and I_1 and I_2 are the currents. Plugging in 100 A for I_1 and I_2, and 20 mm for r, gives 0.1 N. The answer is (I).

Question 5: In a 2 pole lap winding dc machine , the resistance of one conductor is 2Ω and total number of conductors is 100. Find the total resistance

Options: 
A. 50Ω
B. 1Ω
C. 25Ω
D. 200Ω
E. 10Ω
F. 100Ω
G. 500Ω
H. 150Ω
I. 75Ω
J. 20Ω

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. In lap winding, effectively two resistors are connected in parallel, so the actual resistance of each pair is 1 Ohm. Since we have 50 pairs, we get a total resistance of 50 Ohms. The answer is (A).

ANALYSIS:
Let's break down the problem systematically.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We have a capacitor with a capacitance of \( C = 10^{-6} \) farads (or \( 1 \mu F \)). The initial voltage across the capacitor is \( \nu_c(0) = 1 \) volt. We need to find the voltage \( \nu_c(t) \) at time \( t \geq 0 \), given that the current through the capacitor is \( i_C(t) = \cos(10^6 t) \).

2. **Capacitor Current Relationship:**
   The relationship between the current \( i_C(t) \), capacitance \( C \), and voltage \( \nu_c(t) \) across a capacitor is given by the formula:
   \[
   i_C(t) = C \frac{d\nu_c(t)}{dt}
   \]
   Rearranging this gives:
   \[
   \frac{d\nu_c(t)}{dt} = \frac{i_C(t)}{C}
   \]

3. **Substituting Values:**
   Substituting \( C = 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \) and \( i_C(t) = \cos(10^6 t) \) into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{d\nu_c(t)}{dt} = \frac{\cos(10^6 t)}{10^{-6}} = 10^6 \cos(10^6 t)
   \]

4. **Integrating:**
   Now, we need to integrate both sides with respect to time \( t \) to find \( \nu_c(t) \):
   \[
   \nu_c(t) = \int 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) \, dt
   \]

   The integral of \( \cos(k t) \) is \( \frac{1}{k} \sin(k t) \). Here, \( k = 10^6 \):
   \[
   \nu_c(t) = \frac{10^6}{10^6} \sin(10^6 t) + C_1 = \sin(10^6 t) + C_1
   \]
   where \( C_1 \) is the constant of integration.

5. **Initial Condition:**
   We use the initial condition \( \nu_c(0) = 1 \):
   \[
   \nu_c(0) = \sin(10^6 \cdot 0) + C_1 = 0 + C_1 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, \( C_1 = 1 \).

6. **Final Expression for Voltage:**
   Thus, the voltage across the capacitor is:
   \[
   \nu_c(t) = \sin(10^6 t) + 1
   \]
   Alternatively, the equation can be manipulated:
   \[
   \nu_c(t) = 1 + \sin(10^6 t)
   \]

7. **Evaluating Options:**
   Upon evaluating the options given in the question:
   - A. \( 1 + \cos(10^6 t) \) - **Incorrect**
   - B. \( 1 + \sin(10^6 t) \) - **Correct**
   - C. \( 1 - \cos(10^6 t) \) - **Incorrect**
   - D. \( t \cos(10^6 t) \) - **Incorrect**
   - E. \( 1 + \cos(10^4 t) \) - **Incorrect**
   - F. \( 1 - t \cos(10^6 t) \) - **Incorrect**
   - G. \( \sin(10^6 t) - 1 \) - **Incorrect**
   - H. \( 1 - \sin(10^6 t) \) - **Incorrect**
   - I. \( 1 - t \sin(10^6 t) \) - **Incorrect**
   - J. \( 1 - \sin(10^4 t) \) - **Incorrect**

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (B).

Okay, let's analyze this question together.  The problem involves a capacitor with a known capacitance (C = 10⁻⁶ F) and initial voltage (v_c(0) = 1 V). We're given the current through the capacitor as a function of time, i_c(t) = cos(10⁶t), and are asked to find the voltage across the capacitor, v_c(t), for t ≥ 0.

**Analysis:**

The fundamental relationship between current and voltage in a capacitor is given by:

i_c(t) = C * (dv_c(t)/dt)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for v_c(t):

dv_c(t)/dt = i_c(t) / C = cos(10⁶t) / 10⁻⁶ = 10⁶ * cos(10⁶t)

Now we need to integrate both sides with respect to time to find v_c(t):

∫dv_c(t) = ∫10⁶ * cos(10⁶t) dt

v_c(t) = 10⁶ * (1/10⁶) * sin(10⁶t) + K  = sin(10⁶t) + K

where K is the constant of integration.  We can determine K using the initial condition v_c(0) = 1 V:

v_c(0) = sin(0) + K = 1

Therefore, K = 1.

Substituting K back into the equation for v_c(t), we get:

v_c(t) = sin(10⁶t) + 1

This corresponds to option B, although with the sin and 1 switched. Looking at the options available, we need to check if we made a mistake.  Let's double-check the integration.


**Reviewing the integration step:**

The integral of cos(ωt) is (1/ω)sin(ωt) + K. In our case, ω = 10⁶. So the integration is indeed correct.  


**Evaluation of Options:**

* **A. 1 + cos (10⁶t):** Incorrect.  Our analysis shows the voltage should involve a sine function, not a cosine function.

* **B. 1 + sin (10⁶t):** This matches our derived equation v_c(t) = 1 + sin(10⁶t).

* **C. 1 - cos (10⁶t):** Incorrect. Again, the function is a sine, not a cosine.

* **D. t * cos (10⁶t):** Incorrect. The integration of cos(10⁶t) doesn't result in a t*cos(10⁶t) term

* **E. 1 + cos (10⁴t):** Incorrect.  The argument of the trigonometric function is incorrect.

* **F. 1 - t * cos (10⁶t):** Incorrect.  The integration is incorrect.

* **G. sin (10⁶t) - 1:** Incorrect. The constant is incorrect.

* **H. 1 - sin (10⁶t):** Incorrect. The sign of the sine function is incorrect.

* **I. 1 - t*sin (10⁶t):** Incorrect. The integration is incorrect.

* **J. 1 - sin (10⁴t):** Incorrect. The argument of the trigonometric function is incorrect


**Conclusion:**

The answer is (B) 1 + sin(10⁶t)

ANALYSIS:
We analyzed the relationship between the current through a capacitor and the voltage across it. Given that the current \( i_C(t) = \cos(10^6 t) \) and the capacitance \( C = 10^{-6} \) F, we derived that:

Revised response:

ANALYSIS:
The problem involves a capacitor with capacitance C = 10⁻⁶ F and initial voltage v_c(0) = 1 V. The current through the capacitor is given as i_c(t) = cos(10⁶t).  We need to find the voltage v_c(t) for t ≥ 0.

The relationship between current and voltage in a capacitor is: i_c(t) = C * (dv_c(t)/dt).  Rearranging and substituting the given values:

dv_c(t)/dt = cos(10⁶t) / 10⁻⁶ = 10⁶ * cos(10⁶t)

Integrating both sides with respect to time:

v_c(t) = ∫10⁶ * cos(10⁶t) dt = sin(10⁶t) + K

Using the initial condition v_c(0) = 1 V:

1 = sin(0) + K  => K = 1

ANALYSIS:
To solve the problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the current through a capacitor and the voltage across it. Given:

- Capacitance \( C = 10^{-6} \) farads (or \( 1 \mu F \))
- Initial voltage \( \nu_c(0) = 1 \) volt
- Current \( i_C(t) = \cos(10^6 t) \)

The equation relating current and voltage in a capacitor is:
\[
i_C(t) = C \frac{d\nu_c(t)}{dt}
\]

Rearranging this gives us:
\[
\frac{d\nu_c(t)}{dt} = \frac{i_C(t)}{C} = \frac{\cos(10^6 t)}{10^{-6}} = 10^6 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Next, we integrate this equation to find \( \nu_c(t) \):
\[
\nu_c(t) = \int 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) \, dt
\]

Using the result of the integral, we can express \( \nu_c(t) \) as:
\[
\nu_c(t) = \frac{10^6}{10^6} \sin(10^6 t) + K = \sin(10^6 t) + K
\]

Now, we determine the constant \( K \) using the initial condition:
\[
\nu_c(0) = \sin(10^6 \cdot 0) + K = 0 + K = 1 \implies K = 1
\]

Thus, the expression for the voltage across the capacitor becomes:
\[
\nu_c(t) = 1 + \sin(10^6 t)
\]

Now, we evaluate the provided options:
- A. \( 1 + \cos(10^6 t) \) - Incorrect
- B. \( 1 + \sin(10^6 t) \) - Correct
- C. \( 1 - \cos(10^6 t) \) - Incorrect
- D. \( t \cos(10^6 t) \) - Incorrect
- E. \( 1 + \cos(10^4 t) \) - Incorrect
- F. \( 1 - t \cos(10^6 t) \) - Incorrect
- G. \( \sin(10^6 t) - 1 \) - Incorrect
- H. \( 1 - \sin(10^6 t) \) - Incorrect
- I. \( 1 - t \sin(10^6 t) \) - Incorrect
- J. \( 1 - \sin(10^4 t) \) - Incorrect

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (B) 1 + sin(10^6 t).
