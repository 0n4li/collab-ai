The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about biology:

Question 1: Which of the following represents an accurate statement concerning arthropods?

Options: A. They possess an exoskeleton composed primarily of peptidoglycan.
B. They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart.
C. They are members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats and nutrition sources.
D. They lack paired, jointed appendages.

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages, which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B).

Question 2: In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?

Options: A. 19/400
B. 1/400
C. 40/400
D. 38/400
E. 2/400
F. 1/200
G. 20/400
H. 50/400

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. ​The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400. The answer is (D).

Question 3: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?

Options: A. By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum
B. By changing the enzyme's molecular weight
C. An amino acid change away from the active site increases the enzyme's substrate specificity.
D. By changing the shape of the protein
E. By changing the enzyme's temperature optimum
F. By altering the enzyme's ability to be denatured
G. By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell
H. By changing the enzyme's color
I. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.
J. By altering the enzyme's rate of reaction

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. The answer is (D).

Question 4: Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?

Options: A. Translation
B. Conjugation
C. Specialized transduction
D. Transformation

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. The introduction of foreign DNA or RNA into bacteria or eukaryotic cells is a common technique in molecular biology and scientific research. There are multiple ways foreign DNA can be introduced into cells including transformation, transduction, conjugation, and transfection. In contrast, (A) is not a way to form DNA: during translation the ribosomes synthesize proteins from RNA. The answer is (A).

Question 5: Which of the following is not known to be involved in the control of cell division?

Options: A. Microtubules
B. Checkpoints
C. DNA polymerase
D. Centrosomes
E. Cyclins
F. Mitochondria
G. Protein kinases
H. Fibroblast cells

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. Normal cells move through the cell cycle in a regulated way. At the checkpoint stage, they use information about their own internal state and cues from the environment around them to decide whether to proceed with cell division. Cues like these act by changing the activity of core cell cycle regulators inside the cell. The most common regulators are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Fibroblast cells do not play any role in cell division. The answer is (H).

Let's think step by step about the question regarding chemical substances released by organisms that elicit physiological or behavioral responses in other members of the same species.

1. **Understanding the Terms**: We need to identify which of the provided options corresponds to the definition in the question.

2. **Analyzing Each Option**:
   - **A. Auxins**: These are plant hormones that regulate growth but are not typically involved in communication between members of the same species in the way specified.
   - **B. Neurotransmitters**: These are chemical messengers in the nervous system that transmit signals between neurons but primarily act within an organism rather than eliciting a response in others.
   - **C. Enzymes**: These are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms, not involved in signaling or eliciting responses in others.
   - **D. Hormones**: These are regulatory substances produced in an organism and transported in tissue fluids to stimulate specific cells or tissues, but they generally act within the same organism rather than signaling other organisms.
   - **E. Pheromones**: These are specifically chemicals secreted by one individual that influence the behavior or physiology of other individuals of the same species. This fits exactly with the definition provided in the question.
   - **F. Cytokines**: These are signaling molecules that mediate and regulate immunity and inflammation but mostly act within the immune system and not specifically for inter-individual signaling in the same species.
   - **G. Antigens**: These are substances that induce an immune response in the body, not involved in signaling behavior between individuals.
   - **H. Proteins**: This is a broad category that includes various cellular components but doesn't specifically refer to substances that elicit responses in others.
   - **I. Antibodies**: These are proteins produced by the immune system to neutralize pathogens, again not serving as inter-individual communicators.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the definitions and roles of each option, the substances that fit the description of eliciting physiological or behavioral responses in members of the same species are pheromones.

Therefore, the answer is (E).

[//]: # (2024-11-17 19:08:58)
Let's think step by step.  The question asks about chemical substances released by organisms that affect other members of the *same* species. This immediately excludes several options:

* **A. Auxins:** These are plant hormones, affecting the plant itself, not other members of the species.
* **B. Neurotransmitters:** These facilitate communication between nerve cells *within* an organism, not between organisms.
* **C. Enzymes:** These are proteins that catalyze biological reactions within an organism; they don't typically act as interspecies communicators.
* **D. Hormones:** While hormones can influence behavior, they primarily regulate processes *within* the individual organism that produces them.  Some hormones might have secondary effects on others, but that's not their primary function.
* **F. Cytokines:** These are signaling molecules involved in immune responses *within* an organism.
* **G. Antigens:** These trigger immune responses, again, *within* an organism.
* **H. Proteins:**  Too broad a category. Proteins have many functions, and this isn't specific enough.
* **I. Antibodies:** These are proteins produced by the immune system to target foreign substances; they are not interspecies communication signals.

That leaves us with **E. Pheromones** which are specifically defined as chemical messengers released by an organism that elicit a response in other members of the *same* species.  These are responsible for a wide array of behaviors and physiological responses, such as mating, alarm signals, and trail marking.

The answer is (E)

### openai/gpt-4o-mini Discussion Response Round 1:


[//]: # (2024-11-17 19:09:02)
I appreciate your detailed analysis and clarifications regarding the question about chemical substances that affect members of the same species.

I completely agree with your breakdown of the options. You've correctly identified that:
- Auxins and hormones predominantly affect the organism itself rather than others.
- Neurotransmitters facilitate communication within an organism.
- Enzymes, while essential for biochemical processes, do not serve as signaling molecules for other members of a species.
- Cytokines, antigens, proteins, and antibodies also fail to meet the criteria as they are more focused on internal cellular functions or immune responses.

Your emphasis on pheromones being specifically designed to communicate with and elicit responses in members of the same species is spot-on. They play crucial roles in behaviors such as mating and foraging, clearly aligning with the question's focus.

Given this thorough reasoning, I conclude that your assessment is accurate, and therefore, I agree with your points. We can conclude our discussion on this topic. 

The answer is (E).

[//]: # (2024-11-17 19:09:18)
To address the question about chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species, let’s analyze the options provided:

1. **Auxins**: These are plant hormones primarily responsible for growth regulation within the same plant and do not facilitate communication between different organisms.
   
2. **Neurotransmitters**: These are chemicals that transmit signals within an organism's nervous system and do not elicit responses in other individuals.

3. **Enzymes**: These are biological catalysts that assist in metabolic processes within cells but lack any function related to signaling between organisms.

4. **Hormones**: Similar to auxins, hormones are produced by one organism to regulate functions within itself, rather than affecting members of the same species externally.

5. **Pheromones**: These are specifically defined chemical substances that one individual of a species releases into the environment to provoke responses in other individuals of the same species. This directly aligns with the question presented.

6. **Cytokines**: Associated primarily with immune response and communication within the immune system of organisms, these do not influence behavior between different organisms of the same species.

7. **Antigens**: While they can provoke an immune response, they are related to host defense mechanisms rather than inter-individual communication.

8. **Proteins**: This is a broad category that includes numerous types of molecules, many of which do not have signaling functions between organisms.

9. **Antibodies**: These proteins are produced in response to antigens and function within the immune system, again not serving as signaling molecules for behavioral responses.

Given the analysis, pheromones are the only substances listed that meet the criteria of eliciting physiological or behavioral responses in other members of the same species.

Therefore, **the answer is (E)**.

Let's think step by step. The question asks for chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species.  Let's examine the options:

* **Auxins:** Plant hormones regulating growth within the plant itself.
* **Neurotransmitters:** Chemical messengers within a single organism's nervous system.
* **Enzymes:** Biological catalysts facilitating internal reactions.
* **Hormones:** Regulatory substances primarily acting within the organism producing them.
* **Pheromones:** Chemicals specifically released to influence the behavior or physiology of other members of the same species. This directly matches the question's description.
* **Cytokines:** Signaling molecules involved in immune responses within an organism.
* **Antigens:** Substances triggering immune responses within an organism.
* **Proteins:** Too broad a category; many functions, not specific to interspecies communication.
* **Antibodies:** Proteins targeting foreign substances, not involved in communication between organisms.

Only pheromones fit the definition of chemicals eliciting a response in other members of the same species.

The answer is (E)
