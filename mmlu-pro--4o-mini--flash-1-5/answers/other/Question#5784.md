To solve the question regarding Vinton's basis in the apartment building after the exchange, we need to follow the tax principles related to property exchanges, particularly focusing on how to determine the basis when encumbered properties are involved.

1. **Identify the Basis of the Property Exchanged**: 
   - Vinton exchanged unimproved land that had a basis of $300,000.

2. **Consider Fair Market Value (FMV)**: 
   - The FMV of the unimproved land is $420,000.
   - The apartment building being received has an FMV of $550,000.

3. **Evaluate Encumbrance**: 
   - The unimproved land is encumbered by a $100,000 mortgage.
   - The apartment building is encumbered by a $230,000 mortgage.

4. **Calculate the Net Value Received by Vinton**:
   - When Vinton exchanges the land, he takes on the apartment building's mortgage but also gives up his own. Effectively, we need to calculate the net value that Vinton effectively retains. 

5. **Adjustment for Mortgages**:
   - For Vinton, the basis of the apartment building will be calculated as follows:
   - Basis of the land ($300,000) 
   - Plus the amount of the mortgage on the apartment building that Vinton is assuming ($230,000)
   - Minus the mortgage on the land that he is giving up ($100,000)

So, it goes like:
   - Basis in land + Assume apartment mortgage - Payoff land mortgage = New basis
   - $300,000 + $230,000 - $100,000 = $430,000

Based on this calculation, Vinton’s basis in the office building will be $430,000.

Now, let’s choose the correct answer from the options provided:

A. $320,000  
B. $420,000  
C. $300,000  
D. $250,000  
E. $200,000  
F. $350,000  
G. $500,000  
H. $430,000  
I. $600,000  
J. $550,000  

The answer is (H) $430,000.

Let's analyze Vinton's basis in the apartment building step-by-step.  The key to this problem lies in understanding how the mortgages affect the basis.  We're dealing with a like-kind exchange, meaning the tax implications are unique.

**1.  Calculate Vinton's realized gain:**

* Vinton's land FMV: $420,000
* Vinton's land basis: $300,000
* Vinton's realized gain (FMV - basis): $120,000

**2. Account for the mortgages:**

* Mortgage on Vinton's land: $100,000 (This is considered a reduction in the realized gain)
* Mortgage on the apartment building (Vinton assumed): $230,000 (This increases Vinton's basis)

**3. Calculate Vinton's adjusted basis in the apartment building:**

* Start with Vinton's basis in the land: $300,000
* Add the difference between the mortgages: $230,000 (mortgage he assumed) - $100,000 (mortgage he gave up) = $130,000
* Vinton's adjusted basis in the apartment building: $300,000 + $130,000 = $430,000

**Therefore, the answer is (H).**  The realized gain is not directly used to calculate the basis in the new property; instead, the boot (the difference in mortgage values) is added to the original basis.
The answer is (H)

I appreciate your detailed analysis of the situation regarding Vinton's basis in the apartment building, and I think you've provided a thorough breakdown of how the mortgages impact the basis calculation. Let's examine your points step-by-step and see where we align and where there might be nuance worth discussing.

1. **Realized Gain Calculation**:
   - You correctly identified the fair market value and basis of the land, leading to the calculation of the realized gain of $120,000. However, in the context of calculating the basis for the apartment building, the realized gain does not directly influence the basis calculation—it’s more about understanding the implications of the exchange.

2. **Mortgages**:
   - Your mention of the mortgages is spot-on. The fact that Vinton is taking on the new mortgage on the apartment building while giving up the old one indeed affects the adjusted basis. 

3. **Adjusted Basis Calculation**:
   - This is where I see a potential area of difference. While you've calculated the net difference between the mortgages and added that to Vinton's original basis, I would emphasize that the basis in the new property primarily starts with the basis of the old property, and it's correct to consider the assumed mortgage as well as the one being relinquished. You have calculated it accurately resulting in $430,000, which confirms my previous calculation.

In conclusion, both our assessments arrive at the same final basis for Vinton in the apartment building of $430,000, and your explanation and method seem correct in this context. 

Overall, I agree with your points and findings, and I think the discussion can be concluded here since we have reached the same conclusion!

You've presented a very clear and well-reasoned analysis, and I agree with your assessment.  My initial steps were correct in their individual components—calculating realized gain, noting the mortgage implications, and ultimately arriving at the correct adjusted basis. However, your explanation of *why* the realized gain isn't directly used in the final basis calculation is a valuable addition that clarifies the process.  Your point that the basis in the new property starts with the basis of the old property and then considers the mortgage differences is crucial for a complete understanding.  We both correctly arrived at $430,000, but your explanation provides a more robust and fundamental understanding of the underlying tax principles.

I AGREE with all your points and the discussion can be concluded.

Based on the analysis of Vinton’s exchange of unimproved land for an apartment building, the adjusted basis in the apartment building is calculated as follows:

1. **Original basis in the unimproved land**: $300,000
2. **Mortgage on the apartment building assumed**: $230,000
3. **Mortgage on the unimproved land given up**: $100,000

Using the formula: 

**Adjusted Basis = Original Basis + (Assumed Mortgage - Given Up Mortgage)**

We calculate:

**Adjusted Basis = $300,000 + ($230,000 - $100,000) = $300,000 + $130,000 = $430,000.**

Therefore, Vinton’s basis in the apartment building is **$430,000**.

The answer is (H) $430,000.

To determine Vinton's basis in the apartment building after exchanging unimproved land, we analyze the given details step by step while adhering to tax principles related to property exchanges.

1. **Original Basis of Land**: Vinton's unimproved land has a basis of $300,000.

2. **Encumbrances**:
   - The land is encumbered by a $100,000 mortgage.
   - The apartment building that Vinton receives is encumbered by a $230,000 mortgage.

3. **Fair Market Values**:
   - The fair market value of the unimproved land is $420,000.
   - The fair market value of the apartment building is $550,000.

4. **Calculating Adjusted Basis**:
   - When Vinton exchanges the land for the apartment building, we start with the basis of the unimproved land.
   - Vinton assumes the apartment building's $230,000 mortgage while giving up his land's $100,000 mortgage.

The adjusted basis can be calculated using the following formula:

**Adjusted Basis = Basis of the Land + (Mortgage on the Apartment Building Assumed - Mortgage on Land Given Up)**

Plugging in the values:

**Adjusted Basis = $300,000 + ($230,000 - $100,000)**
**Adjusted Basis = $300,000 + $130,000 = $430,000**

Thus, Vinton’s basis in the apartment building is **$430,000**.

The answer is (H) $430,000.

Let's think step by step.  Vinton exchanged land with a basis of $300,000 for an apartment building.  The land had a fair market value of $420,000 and a $100,000 mortgage. The building had a fair market value of $550,000 and a $230,000 mortgage.  Each party assumed the other's mortgage.

To determine Vinton's basis in the apartment building, we start with the basis of the land he gave up ($300,000).  He assumed a $230,000 mortgage on the building and relinquished a $100,000 mortgage on his land.  The net effect of the mortgages is an increase of $130,000 ($230,000 - $100,000).

Therefore, Vinton's basis in the apartment building is $300,000 (original basis) + $130,000 (net mortgage difference) = $430,000.

The answer is (H)
