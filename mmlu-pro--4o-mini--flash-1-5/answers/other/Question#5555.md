Let's think step by step about the best option for removing ink stains among the choices provided.

1. **Hair Spray (A)**: Hair spray is known for containing alcohol, which can work to break down ink stains. Many people have had success using hair spray directly on the stain, making this a potentially useful option.

2. **Butter (B)**: Butter is oily but doesn’t typically help with dissolving or breaking down the ink. Using butter could actually worsen the stain, making it less effective as a cleaning agent.

3. **Toothpaste (C)**: While toothpaste can sometimes be used for various types of stains due to its mild abrasive properties, it is generally not considered effective for ink removal specifically.

4. **Baking Soda (D)**: Baking soda can be mixed with water to form a paste. While it does have cleaning properties and can help lift some stains, it is not specifically known for removing ink stains effectively.

5. **Nail Polish (E)**: Nail polish remover, which typically contains acetone, can be effective on certain types of ink stains. However, straight nail polish itself is not effective for removing ink.

6. **Olive Oil (F)**: Olive oil is more of a cooking ingredient and is not known for its stain-removing properties. It might not effectively lift or dissolve ink.

7. **Coffee Grounds (G)**: Coffee grounds are often used for scrubbing or deodorizing but are not recognized as a remedy for ink stains specifically.

Considering all the options, hair spray (A) stands out as a common home remedy for ink stains, due to its alcohol content and the ability to help break down ink.

Thus, the analysis leads me to conclude that the most useful item for removing ink stains from the provided options is hair spray. 

The answer is (A).

Let's think step by step.  The question asks which of the listed items is useful for removing ink stains. We need to consider the properties of each item and how they might interact with ink.

* **A. Hairspray:** Hairspray contains alcohol and polymers.  Alcohol can sometimes be effective at dissolving certain types of ink, particularly those that are water-based.  The polymers might help lift the ink from the fabric.

* **B. Butter:** Butter is a fat. Fats are not likely to be effective at dissolving ink.  They might actually make the stain worse by spreading it or making it harder to remove later.

* **C. Toothpaste:** Toothpaste contains abrasives and mild detergents. The abrasive properties could potentially help to scrub away some ink, but it's not a reliable method and could damage the fabric.

* **D. Baking soda:** Baking soda is a mild abrasive and can be used as a cleaning agent. Its abrasive action might help lift some ink from surfaces, but its effectiveness is limited, and it depends on the material it's used on.

* **E. Nail polish:** Nail polish is likely to make the situation worse, as it's a coating itself, and probably not something you want to try on clothes.

* **F. Olive oil:** Similar to butter, olive oil is a fat. It's unlikely to be effective and might even worsen the stain.

* **G. Coffee grounds:** Coffee grounds are a coarse material. While their abrasive properties might offer some cleaning, it's unlikely to be particularly effective against ink stains compared to other options.


Considering all the options, hairspray offers the most likely chance of successfully removing an ink stain based on the chemical properties of its components (alcohol).  Baking soda has a slight chance, but is less reliable.  The other options are generally ineffective or likely to make the situation worse.

The answer is (A)

[//]: # (2024-11-17 21:03:53)
I appreciate your thorough analysis on the question of which item is useful for removing ink stains. Your breakdown of each option is well-articulated, and I find it aligns closely with general knowledge on the subject.

1. **Hairspray (A)**: I agree with your points about hairspray containing alcohol, which can help dissolve certain types of ink. The inclusion of polymers might also aid in lifting the stain, making it a strong candidate for our answer.

2. **Butter (B)**: Your explanation is spot-on; butter's fat content could indeed exacerbate the problem by spreading the ink, which most people would want to avoid.

3. **Toothpaste (C)**: I see your point regarding toothpaste having some scrubbing potential due to its abrasiveness. However, it might still not be the best solution since it isn't widely recommended for this specific issue.

4. **Baking Soda (D)**:  You correctly indicate that while baking soda has some cleaning properties, it might not be effective for ink stains specifically. 

5. **Nail Polish (E)**: I also agree that using nail polish is likely to make the stain worse, as it could add more substance rather than help remove it.

6. **Olive Oil (F)**: Like you mentioned, olive oil is another fat that would be unlikely to help remove the stain.

7. **Coffee Grounds (G)**: Your insight into coffee grounds and their mild abrasiveness is valid, though they are far from a reliable solution to ink stains.

Overall, I appreciate how you've noted that hairspray provides the best chance for ink removal among the listed items. Your points on the ineffective options are also well-reasoned, and I see no major flaws in your assessment.

Thus, I AGREE with your perspective, and I think we can conclude this discussion.

Let's think step by step about which item is best for removing ink stains.

Hair spray often contains alcohol, which can dissolve some inks.  The other options are less likely to be effective or could even worsen the stain. Butter and olive oil are fats that could spread the ink. Toothpaste and baking soda are mildly abrasive but not specifically designed for ink removal. Nail polish would make the problem worse. Coffee grounds are abrasive but unlikely to be effective against ink.

Therefore, hair spray is the most promising option.

The answer is (A)
