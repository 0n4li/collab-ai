To answer the question about the due date for filing a federal estate tax return (Form 706) when a taxpayer dies on May 15 of year 2, we can break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding Form 706**: Form 706 is used to report the estate’s value and to calculate any federal estate tax owed. There are specific rules regarding when this form needs to be filed.

2. **General Deadline for Form 706**: The due date for filing Form 706 is typically nine months after the date of death of the individual, unless an extension is filed. According to IRS guidelines, if no extension is requested, the return must be filed within this nine-month window.

3. **Calculating the Deadline**:
   - The individual died on May 15 of year 2.
   - Adding nine months to May 15 puts us at February 15 of year 3.
   - Therefore, the return is due on February 15 of year 3.

4. **Reviewing the Options**: 
   - A. October 15, year 2.
   - B. April 15, year 3.
   - C. January 31, year 3.
   - D. November 15, year 2.
   - E. December 31, year 2.
   - F. May 15, year 3.
   - G. March 15, year 3.
   - H. February 15, year 3.  (This option matches our calculation)
   - I. September 15, year 2.
   - J. August 15, year 2.

From this analysis, we can see that the correct option is H, which states February 15, year 3, as the due date.

Thus, the answer is (H).

Let's think step by step.  The question asks about the due date of a federal estate tax return (Form 706) without an extension.  The key piece of information is the decedent's date of death: May 15, Year 2.

Generally, estate tax returns are due nine months after the date of death.  Therefore, we need to calculate nine months from May 15, Year 2.

Counting nine months from May 15th:

* May 15 + 1 month = June 15
* June 15 + 1 month = July 15
* July 15 + 1 month = August 15
* August 15 + 1 month = September 15
* September 15 + 1 month = October 15
* October 15 + 1 month = November 15
* November 15 + 1 month = December 15
* December 15 + 1 month = January 15 (Year 3)
* January 15 + 1 month = February 15 (Year 3)

Therefore, the due date is February 15th, Year 3.

However, none of the provided options exactly match February 15th, Year 3. There's a possibility the question or options contain an error, or there's a nuance to estate tax deadlines I am not considering that is found in further tax code specifications. 

It's worth noting that option (H), February 15, year 3, is the closest and most logical answer based on the general nine-month rule.



The answer is (H)

* August 15 + 1 month = September 15
* September 15 + 1 month = October 15
