To calculate the inventory turnover for Baxter Co, we need to understand what inventory turnover means. It's a measure of how efficiently a company manages its inventory. The formula for calculating inventory turnover is:

\[ \text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}} \]

1. **Determine the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** We're given that the COGS for the year is $500,000.

2. **Calculate Average Inventory:**
   To calculate the average inventory, we need to find the average of the beginning and ending inventory. 
   - Beginning Inventory = $200,000
   - Ending Inventory = $300,000
   - Average Inventory = \( \frac{\text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \frac{200,000 + 300,000}{2} = \frac{500,000}{2} = 250,000 \)

3. **Apply the values to the formula:**
   \[
   \text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2
   \]

Now that we have calculated the inventory turnover ratio, we look at the options given:

Options: 
A. 2.5  
B. 0.5  
C. 3  
D. 1  
E. 3.5  
F. 1.75  
G. 2.25  
H. 4  
I. 2  
J. 1.5  

Since our calculation gives us an inventory turnover of 2, the correct choice from the options provided is:

The answer is (I).

Let's think step by step.  Inventory turnover is a ratio that shows how many times a company has sold and replaced its inventory during a period.  The formula to calculate inventory turnover is:

**Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory**

First, we need to calculate the average inventory.  Average inventory is the average value of inventory held during a reporting period.  It's calculated as:

**(Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2**

In Baxter Co.'s case:

* Beginning Inventory = $200,000
* Ending Inventory = $300,000

Average Inventory = ($200,000 + $300,000) / 2 = $250,000

Now, we can calculate the inventory turnover:

Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory = $500,000 / $250,000 = 2

Therefore, Baxter's inventory turnover for the year was 2.

The answer is (I)

To determine Baxter Co.'s inventory turnover, we use the inventory turnover formula, which is:

\[ \text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}} \]

1. **Identify the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** The provided COGS is $500,000.

2. **Calculate Average Inventory:**
   - Beginning Inventory = $200,000
   - Ending Inventory = $300,000
   - Average Inventory = \( \frac{\text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \frac{200,000 + 300,000}{2} = \frac{500,000}{2} = 250,000 \)

3. **Calculate Inventory Turnover:**
   \[
   \text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2
   \]

After performing the calculations, we find that Baxter's inventory turnover for the year is 2.

Given the available options:
A. 2.5  
B. 0.5  
C. 3  
D. 1  
E. 3.5  
F. 1.75

Let's think step by step.  Inventory turnover is calculated as Cost of Goods Sold divided by Average Inventory.  Average inventory is (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2.

For Baxter Co:

* Beginning Inventory = $200,000
* Ending Inventory = $300,000
* Cost of Goods Sold = $500,000

Average Inventory = ($200,000 + $300,000) / 2 = $250,000

Inventory Turnover = $500,000 / $250,000 = 2

The answer is (I).
