The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about economics:

Question 1: For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will

Options: 
A. Never occur
B. Persist indefinitely
C. Cause a permanent change in the trend
D. Grow exponentially
E. Only affect the next period
F. Eventually die away
G. Cause the process to become non-stationary
H. Immediately disappear
I. Lead to a cyclical pattern
J. Be balanced out by subsequent shocks

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. This is a formal logic problem about stationally process. For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will eventually die away. The answer is (F).

Question 2: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by

Options: 
A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question 3: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?
(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis
(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used
(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used
(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.

Options: 
A. (iii) and (iv) only
B. (i) and (iv) only
C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only
D. (i) and (ii) only
E. (i) and (iii) only
F. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).
G. (ii), (iii), and (iv) only
H. (ii) and (iii) only
I. (ii) and (iv) only
J. (i), (iii), and (iv) only

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s reason about each of the options.
(i) is a true statement.
(ii) is a true statement.
(iii) is a true statement.
(iv) is not a true statement. Thus, (i), (ii), and (iii) are true. The answer is (C).

Question 4: Which of the following policies best describes supply-side fiscal policy?

Options: 
A. Higher taxes on household income
B. Increased government spending
C. Increased taxes on corporate profits
D. Increased import tariffs
E. Decreased interest rates
F. Lower taxes on consumer goods
G. Lower taxes on research and development of new technology
H. Reduced government spending
I. Higher taxes on capital gains
J. An increase in the money supply

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Supply-side fiscal policy stimulates the economy by encouraging more production of goods and services through reduction in taxes and deregulation. The answer is (G).

Question 5: The concentration ratio for a monopoly is

Options: 
A. 50
B. 5
C. 10
D. 90
E. 15
F. 100
G. 0
H. 25
I. 75

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. The concentration ratio is calculated as the sum of market share of a specific number of largest companies. Monopoly means one company or entity controls the entire market, therefore, the concentration ratio is 100 percent. The answer is (F).

ANALYSIS:
To find the excess reserves of a commercial bank, we first need to understand the definitions and calculations involved:

1. **Required Reserves**: This is the amount that a bank is required to hold as reserves based on the required reserve ratio. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Required Reserves} = \text{Total Deposits} \times \text{Required Reserve Ratio}
   \]

2. **Excess Reserves**: These are the reserves that a bank holds above the required reserves. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Excess Reserves} = \text{Actual Reserves} - \text{Required Reserves}
   \]

Now, let’s plug in the numbers from the question:

- Total Deposits = $400,000
- Required Reserve Ratio = 20% = 0.20
- Loans and Investments = $315,000 (this information is not directly necessary for calculating excess reserves but helps frame the bank's balance sheet)

Step 1: Calculate the Required Reserves:
   \[
   \text{Required Reserves} = 400,000 \times 0.20 = 80,000
   \]

Step 2: Determine Actual Reserves:
   Actual reserves consist of the amount that banks still retain after their loans and investments. Since deposits are the only source of reserves, the bank’s actual reserves can be derived from its total deposits:
   - Actual Reserves = Total Deposits - Loans and Investments
   \[
   \text{Actual Reserves} = 400,000 - 315,000 = 85,000
   \]

Step 3: Calculate Excess Reserves:
   \[
   \text{Excess Reserves} = \text{Actual Reserves} - \text{Required Reserves} = 85,000 - 80,000 = 5,000
   \]

Now, let’s evaluate the options given in the question:
- A. $85,000 (This is the actual reserves)
- B. $80,000 (This is the required reserves)
- C. $5,000 (This matches our calculation of excess reserves)
- D. $315,000 (This represents total loans and investments)

Based on the calculations above:

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (C) $5,000.

ANALYSIS:

**1. Question Interpretation:** The question asks us to calculate the excess reserves of a commercial bank.  Excess reserves are the amount a bank has in reserves above and beyond what is legally required. We are given the bank's deposits, loans and investments, and the required reserve ratio.

**2. Calculating Required Reserves:**

* The bank has deposits of $400,000.
* The required reserve ratio is 20%, meaning the bank must hold 20% of its deposits as reserves.
* Required reserves = Deposits * Required reserve ratio = $400,000 * 0.20 = $80,000

**3. Calculating Actual Reserves:**

* The bank's only source of reserves is deposits, which are $400,000.
* The bank has made loans and investments totaling $315,000.
* Therefore, the bank's actual reserves are $400,000 - $315,000 = $85,000

**4. Calculating Excess Reserves:**

* Excess reserves are the difference between actual reserves and required reserves.
* Excess reserves = Actual reserves - Required reserves = $85,000 - $80,000 = $5,000

**5. Evaluating Options:**

* **A. $85,000:** This is the bank's actual reserves, not its excess reserves.
* **B. $80,000:** This is the bank's required reserves.
* **C. $5,000:** This is the correct answer, representing the difference between actual and required reserves.
* **D. $315,000:** This represents the bank's loans and investments, which is not relevant to excess reserves.

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (C)

ANALYSIS:
To determine the excess reserves of a commercial bank, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Understanding Required Reserves**: Required reserves are the amounts that a bank must hold as reserves based on the required reserve ratio. The formula to calculate required reserves is:
   \[
   \text{Required Reserves} = \text{Total Deposits} \times \text{Required Reserve Ratio}
   \]

2. **Understanding Actual Reserves**: These are the total reserves that the bank holds, which consist of deposits minus loans and investments. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Actual Reserves} = \text{Total Deposits} - \text{Loans and Investments}
   \]

3. **Understanding Excess Reserves**: These are the reserves held above the required reserves. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Excess Reserves} = \text{Actual Reserves} - \text{Required Reserves}
   \]

Now, let’s analyze the numbers provided in the question:

- Total Deposits = $400,000
- Required Reserve Ratio = 20% (or 0.20)
- Loans and Investments = $315,000

Step 1: Calculate the Required Reserves:
   \[
   \text{Required Reserves} = 400,000 \times 0.20 = 80,000
   \]

Step 2: Determine the Actual Reserves:
   \[
   \text{Actual Reserves} = 400,000 - 315,000 = 85,000
   \]

Step 3: Calculate the Excess Reserves:
   \[
   \text{Excess Reserves} = 85,000 - 80,000 = 5,000
   \]

Now, let’s evaluate the options given in the question:
- A. $85,000 (This is the actual reserves)
- B. $80,000 (This represents the required reserves)
- C. $5,000 (This matches our calculation of excess reserves)
- D. $315,000 (This represents the total loans and investments)

Based on the calculations above, we confirm that the correct answer, representing the excess reserves, is indeed (C) $5,000.

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (C) $5,000.

ANALYSIS:
The question asks for the excess reserves of a commercial bank.  Excess reserves are the reserves held by a bank above the legally required minimum.

1. **Calculate Required Reserves:** The required reserve ratio is 20%, and deposits are $400,000.  Therefore, required reserves are 20% of $400,000, which equals $80,000.

2. **Calculate Actual Reserves:** The bank has $400,000 in deposits and has made loans and investments totaling $315,000.  Subtracting the loans and investments from the deposits gives us the actual reserves: $400,000 - $315,000 = $85,000.

3. **Calculate Excess Reserves:** Excess reserves are the difference between actual reserves and required reserves: $85,000 - $80,000 = $5,000.

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (C) $5,000
