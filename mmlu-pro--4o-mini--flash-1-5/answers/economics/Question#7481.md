The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about economics:

Question 1: For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will

Options: A. Never occur
B. Persist indefinitely
C. Cause a permanent change in the trend
D. Grow exponentially
E. Only affect the next period
F. Eventually die away
G. Cause the process to become non-stationary
H. Immediately disappear
I. Lead to a cyclical pattern
J. Be balanced out by subsequent shocks

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. This is a formal logic problem about stationally process. For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will eventually die away. The answer is (F).

Question 2: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by

Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question 3: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?
(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis
(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used
(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used
(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.

Options: A. (iii) and (iv) only

G. (ii), (iii), and (iv) only
H. (ii) and (iii) only
I. (ii) and (iv) only
J. (i), (iii), and (iv) only

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s reason about each of the options.
(i) is a true statement.
(ii) is a true statement.
(iii) is a true statement.
(iv) is not a true statement. Thus, (i), (ii), and (iii) are true. The answer is (C).

I. Higher taxes on capital gains
J. An increase in the money supply

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Supply-side fiscal policy stimulates the economy by encouraging more production of goods and services through reduction in taxes and deregulation. The answer is (G).

Question 5: The concentration ratio for a monopoly is

Options: A. 50
B. 5
C. 10
D. 90
E. 15
F. 100

To solve this question, we first need to understand the concepts of reserves, demand deposits, and the required reserve ratio.

1. **Understanding Required Reserves**: The required reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks are required to keep on hand and not lend out. In this case, the required reserve ratio is 20%, meaning that for every dollar in demand deposits, the bank must keep $0.20 in reserves.

2. **Calculating Required Reserves**: Since the current demand deposits are $2000, let's calculate how much the bank needs to keep as required reserves:
   \[
   \text{Required Reserves} = \text{Demand Deposits} \times \text{Required Reserve Ratio}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Required Reserves} = 2000 \times 0.20 = 400
   \]

3. **Total Reserves**: The bank has total reserves of $1000. 

4. **Excess Reserves Calculation**: Excess reserves are calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Excess Reserves} = \text{Total Reserves} - \text{Required Reserves}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Excess Reserves} = 1000 - 400 = 600
   \]
   This means the bank has $600 in excess reserves that can be used for additional lending.

5. **Money Multiplier Effect**: The money multiplier is calculated as the reciprocal of the required reserve ratio:
   \[
   \text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{Required Reserve Ratio}} = \frac{1}{0.20} = 5
   \]

6. **Potential Expansion of Demand Deposits**: The amount by which demand deposits can expand, based purely on the excess reserves, can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Potential Expansion} = \text{Excess Reserves} \times \text{Money Multiplier}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Potential Expansion} = 600 \times 5 = 3000
   \]

This means that with the excess reserves of $600, the bank can theoretically expand its demand deposits by $3000.

Now let’s assess the options:

A. $2000  
B. $400  
C. $1200  
D. $800  
E. $10000  
F. $5000  
G. $3000  
H. $600  
I. $1600  
J. $7000  

The correct answer is G. 

Therefore, the answer is **The answer is (G) $3000**.

Let's think step by step.  The question asks about the potential expansion of demand deposits in a banking system given a specific reserve ratio.  Here's how to break down the problem:

1. **Calculate Excess Reserves:** The bank has total reserves of $1000 and demand deposits of $2000. The required reserve ratio is 20%.  This means the bank must hold 20% of its demand deposits as reserves.  

Required reserves = 20% * $2000 = $400

Excess reserves are the reserves a bank holds above the required amount.

Excess reserves = Total reserves - Required reserves = $1000 - $400 = $600

2. **Money Multiplier:** The money multiplier determines how much the money supply can expand based on the excess reserves and the reserve requirement. The formula is:

Money Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Requirement Ratio = 1 / 0.20 = 5

3. **Potential Expansion of Demand Deposits:** The potential expansion in demand deposits is calculated by multiplying the excess reserves by the money multiplier.

Potential expansion = Excess reserves * Money Multiplier = $600 * 5 = $3000

Therefore, the amount by which demand deposits can expand in the banking system is $3000.

The answer is (G)

[//]: # (2024-11-17 20:01:27)
I appreciate your detailed breakdown of the problem, and I see that you've approached the question systematically. Let's go through your points together.

1. **Calculating Excess Reserves**: You correctly calculated the required reserves as $400 based on the reserve ratio of 20%. This is a critical step, and I agree with your calculation of excess reserves being $600. You've laid out the math accurately.

2. **Money Multiplier**: Your explanation of the money multiplier is spot on. You rightly calculated the money multiplier as 5, which is fundamental in evaluating how much the demand deposits can expand based on the excess reserves. 

3. **Potential Expansion of Demand Deposits**: You've also correctly applied the money multiplier to the excess reserves, yielding a potential expansion of $3000. This aligns perfectly with the principles of fractional reserve banking.

Thus, after reviewing your perspective, I can confirm that I AGREE with all your points, and I believe our discussion on this matter can be concluded. You’ve presented a thorough explanation and arrived at the correct answer together. Thank you for this constructive dialogue!

To determine the amount by which demand deposits can expand in the banking system with a total reserve of $1000 and demand deposits of $2000, while adhering to a 20% required reserve ratio, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Calculate Required Reserves**: The required reserve ratio tells us how much of the demand deposits must be maintained as reserves. In this case:
   \[
   \text{Required Reserves} = \text{Demand Deposits} \times \text{Required Reserve Ratio} = 2000 \times 0.20 = 400
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Reserves**: The bank has total reserves of $1000.

3. **Calculate Excess Reserves**: Excess reserves are the reserves held over and above the required amount:
   \[
   \text{Excess Reserves} = \text{Total Reserves} - \text{Required Reserves} = 1000 - 400 = 600
   \]

4. **Determine Money Multiplier**: The money multiplier effect can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{Required Reserve Ratio}} = \frac{1}{0.20} = 5
   \]

5. **Calculate Potential Expansion of Demand Deposits**: The potential increase in demand deposits due to the excess reserves can be calculated using the money multiplier:
   \[
   \text{Potential Expansion} = \text{Excess Reserves} \times \text{Money Multiplier} = 600 \times 5 = 3000
   \]

Therefore, with the above calculations, the amount by which demand deposits can expand in the banking system is $3000.

**The answer is (G) $3000.**

Let's think step by step.  The question asks how much demand deposits can expand given $1000 in total reserves, $2000 in demand deposits, and a 20% required reserve ratio.

1. **Calculate Required Reserves:**  The bank must hold 20% of $2000 in reserves, which is $400 (0.20 * $2000 = $400).

2. **Calculate Excess Reserves:** Excess reserves are the difference between total reserves and required reserves: $1000 (total reserves) - $400 (required reserves) = $600.

3. **Calculate the Money Multiplier:** The money multiplier is the inverse of the reserve requirement: 1 / 0.20 = 5.

4. **Calculate Potential Expansion:** The potential expansion of demand deposits is the excess reserves multiplied by the money multiplier: $600 * 5 = $3000.

Therefore, the amount by which demand deposits can expand is $3000.

The answer is (G)
