The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about computer science:

Question 1: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:
ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.
Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?

Options: A. 10
B. 6
C. 9
D. 5
E. 12
F. 4
G. 7
H. 8

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.
Next, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.
Next, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.
We can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:
compute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3
compute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4
compute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5
compute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6
STALL
compute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7
So there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).

Question 2: A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.
G := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F
The target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is

Options: A. 7
B. 5
C. 12
D. 4
E. 11
F. 6
G. 8
H. 10
I. 9
J. 3

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:
1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)
2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)
3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)
4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)
5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)
6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)
7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)
8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)
9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)
This sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (I).

Question 3: SHA-1 has a message digest of

Options: A. 628 bits
B. 780 bits
C. 160 bits
D. 256 bits
E. 2048 bits
F. 820 bits
G. 128 bits
H. 512 bits
I. 1024 bits
J. 64 bits

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. Since SHA-1 is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, its message digest is 160 bits. The answer is (C).

Question 4: _____________ can modify data on your system – so that your system doesn’t run correctly or you can no longer access specific data, or it may even ask for ransom in order to give your access.

Options: A. Email Trojans
B. Backdoor Trojans
C. Rootkit Trojans
D. Banking Trojans
E. Trojan-Downloader
F. Spyware Trojans
G. Network Trojans
H. Worm Trojans
I. Ransom Trojan
J. IM – Trojans

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. The system is asking for trojans, which are for ransom, which means ransom trojan. The answer is (I).

Question 5: In the program below, the initial value of X is 5 and the initial value of Y is 10.
IF (X < 0){
 DISPLAY ("Foxtrot")
} ELSE {
 IF (X > Y){
  DISPLAY ("Hotel")
 } ELSE {
  IF (Y > 0){
   DISPLAY ("November")
  } ELSE {
   DISPLAY ("Yankee")
  }
 }
}
What is displayed as a result of running the program?

Options: A. November
B. Foxtrot
C. Zulu
D. Alpha
E. Charlie
F. Bravo
G. Yankee
H. Echo
I. Hotel
J. Delta

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. Because X has the value 5, the first conditional IF (X < 0) is false, so we move to the first ELSE clause. Because X is 5 and Y is 10, the second conditional IF (X > Y) is false, so we move to the following ELSE clause. Since Y is 10, the conditional IF (Y > 0) is true, so the command DISPLAY ("November") is executed. The answer is (A).

Let’s analyze the statements regarding Ethernets step by step:

**Option A: Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly.**
- This statement is true. Traditional Ethernet protocols (like CSMA/CD) utilize a collision detection method, particularly in shared networks. When two devices transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs, and the protocols have mechanisms to detect this and retry the transmission.

**Option B: Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages.**
- This statement is false. Ethernets are based on packet switching, not circuit switching. In circuit switching, a dedicated circuit is established for the duration of the communication, which doesn't happen in Ethernet networks. Instead, Ethernet sends data in packets over a shared medium without needing a dedicated path.

**Option C: Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters.**
- This statement can be context-dependent but is generally true for standard Ethernet setups using twisted pair cables (like 100Base-T). There are different types of Ethernet that can support longer distances (for example, fiber optics), but traditional copper Ethernet does have a length limitation.

**Option D: Ethernets use buses with multiple masters.**
- This statement is somewhat misleading. Traditional bus-based implementations of Ethernet, like the original coaxial cable Ethernet, did operate in a bus topology where multiple devices could listen and transmit (thus multiple masters). However, modern Ethernet has evolved, and most implementations now use a star topology with switches, which is fundamentally different. Still, the concept of multiple devices sharing the medium in older bus Ethernet remains true.

After analyzing each option, we can conclude that **Option B** is the only statement that is typically false regarding Ethernets because they do not use circuit switching but rather rely on packet switching.

Therefore, the answer is **The answer is (B)**.

Let's analyze each statement about Ethernet to determine which is false.

A. **Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly.**  This is generally TRUE.  Early Ethernet used CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection).  While modern Ethernet (like Gigabit Ethernet and beyond) uses switches to avoid collisions, the foundational principle of collision detection was crucial to the original Ethernet standard.  So, while less relevant now, this statement isn't inherently false.

B. **Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages.** This is FALSE. Ethernet uses packet switching, not circuit switching. Circuit switching establishes a dedicated path between two communicating devices before transmission begins, while packet switching breaks data into packets that are individually routed across the network.  Ethernet's fundamental nature is packet-switched.

C. **Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters.** This is generally TRUE, especially for older Ethernet standards.  Signal attenuation limits the maximum cable length. While techniques like repeaters and switches extended the reach, the basic physical limitations still exist.  Modern standards have increased the maximum distance, but the statement is not entirely false.

D. **Ethernets use buses with multiple masters.** This is TRUE, especially for older Ethernet implementations.  A bus topology, common in early Ethernet, involved multiple devices sharing the same communication channel.  Each device acts as a 'master' in that it initiates transmissions.  While modern Ethernet primarily uses switched architectures, the historical context makes this true.


Therefore, the statement that is typically FALSE is B.  Ethernet fundamentally relies on packet switching, not circuit switching.

The answer is (B)

### openai/gpt-4o-mini Discussion Response Round 1:


[//]: # (2024-11-17 21:51:32)
I appreciate your detailed analysis on the statements regarding Ethernets, and I feel like we are aligned in many respects. Let's break down my perspective on each of the points you made:

**A. Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly.**
- I agree with your assessment that this statement is generally true. While modern Ethernets, especially those utilizing switches, minimize the relevance of collision detection, the statement accurately reflects the historical context. It’s important to note that it was a significant aspect of early Ethernet technology.

**B. Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages.**
- I completely concur with your conclusion that this statement is false. Your explanation of the difference between circuit switching and packet switching is clear and accurate. Ethernet fundamentally utilizes packet switching principles, which aligns with the nature of bandwidth usage and data transmission in local area networks.

**C. Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters.**
- I agree with your observations here. The length limitation is applicable to older Ethernet standards using twisted pair cables, though modern standards indeed support greater distances through different cabling techniques like fiber optics. Your point that the statement is not entirely false is important because it reflects the evolving nature of Ethernet technology.

**D. Ethernets use buses with multiple masters.**
- I also find your point valid. While it is true that earlier Ethernet implementations employed a bus topology where devices functioned collectively, the transition to switched networks in modern applications does change the landscape of how we interpret multiple masters in the context of Ethernet.

In summary, I believe we have both effectively identified that the typically false statement is **B**, regarding circuit switching. Given our consensus on the points analyzed, I feel comfortable agreeing with your overall perspective.

Therefore, I AGREE with all your points, and I believe the discussion can be concluded.

[//]: # (2024-11-17 21:51:33)
I agree with your thorough analysis and well-articulated points.  We've both correctly identified the core issue: statement B is false because Ethernet uses packet switching, not circuit switching.  Your breakdown of each option, including the nuances of historical context and modern implementations, is excellent.  I particularly appreciate your acknowledgement of the context-dependent nature of statements C and D.

Therefore, I AGREE with all your points, and the discussion can be concluded.
