The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about physics:

Question 1: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?

Options: A. 1000 times more
B. 50 times more
C. 5000 times more
D. 500 times more
E. 10000 times more
F. 20000 times more
G. 2000 times more
H. 100 times more
I. 10 times more

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (E).

Question 2: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?

Options: A. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.
B. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.
C. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.
D. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
E. The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud.
F. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
G. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).

Question 3: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is

Options: A. 10
B. 40
C. 6
D. 25
E. 15
F. 50
G. 30
H. 4
I. 5
J. 20

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (H).

Question 4: Colors in a soap bubble result from light

Options: A. dispersion
B. deflection
C. refraction
D. reflection
E. interference
F. converted to a different frequency
G. polarization
H. absorption
I. diffraction
J. transmission

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors being visible. The answer is (E).

Question 5: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?

Options: A. 240 W
B. 120 W
C. 10 W
D. 480 W
E. 360 W
F. 200 W
G. 30 W
H. 150 W
I. 60 W
J. 300 W

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (A).

To determine the specific heat of alcohol when mixed with water and contained in a glass container, we can use the principle of conservation of energy, where the heat lost by the alcohol will equal the heat gained by the water and the glass container.

### Step 1: Set Up the Equation
The heat lost or gained can be calculated using the formula:
\[
Q = mc\Delta T
\]
Where:
- \(Q\) is the heat absorbed or released
- \(m\) is the mass
- \(c\) is the specific heat
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature

### Step 2: Identify the Known Values
1. **Alcohol:**
   - Mass (\(m_{alcohol}\)) = 500 g
   - Initial temperature (\(T_{i,alcohol}\)) = 75°C
   - Final temperature (\(T_f\)) = 46°C
   - Change in temperature (\(\Delta T_{alcohol}\)) = \(T_f - T_{i,alcohol} = 46°C - 75°C = -29°C\)

2. **Water:**
   - Mass (\(m_{water}\)) = 500 g
   - Initial temperature (\(T_{i,water}\)) = 30°C
   - Change in temperature (\(\Delta T_{water}\)) = \(T_f - T_{i,water} = 46°C - 30°C = 16°C\)
   - Specific heat of water (\(c_{water}\)) = 1 cal/g°C

3. **Glass:**
   - Mass (\(m_{glass}\)) = 300 g
   - Specific heat of glass (\(c_{glass}\)) = 0.14 cal/g°C
   - Change in temperature (\(\Delta T_{glass}\)) = 16°C (it reaches the same final temperature as water)

### Step 3: Write the Heat Exchange Equation
According to the principle of conservation of energy:
\[
Q_{lost, alcohol} + Q_{gained, water} + Q_{gained, glass} = 0
\]

This can be rearranged as:
\[
m_{alcohol} \cdot c_{alcohol} \cdot \Delta T_{alcohol} + m_{water} \cdot c_{water} \cdot \Delta T_{water} + m_{glass} \cdot c_{glass} \cdot \Delta T_{glass} = 0
\]

### Step 4: Plug in the Values
Plugging in the known values:
\[
(500 \, g) \cdot c_{alcohol} \cdot (-29°C) + (500 \, g) \cdot (1 \, \text{cal/g°C}) \cdot (16°C) + (300 \, g) \cdot (0.14 \, \text{cal/g°C}) \cdot (16°C) = 0
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Each Term
1. Heat gained by water:
\[
Q_{water} = 500 \cdot 1 \cdot 16 = 8000 \, \text{cal}
\]

2. Heat gained by the glass:
\[
Q_{glass} = 300 \cdot 0.14 \cdot 16 = 672 \, \text{cal}
\]

3. Total heat gained:
\[
Q_{gained} = 8000 + 672 = 8672 \, \text{cal}
\]

4. Heat lost by alcohol:
\[
-500 \cdot c_{alcohol} \cdot 29 = -8672 \, \text{cal}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for Specific Heat of Alcohol
Rearranging gives:
\[
c_{alcohol} = \frac{8672}{500 \cdot 29}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
c_{alcohol} = \frac{8672}{14500} \approx 0.597 \, \text{cal/g°C}
\]

### Step 7: Choose the Closest Answer
Looking at the options provided, the closest value to our calculation is:
- E. 0.598 cal/g°C

Thus, the final answer is:
The answer is (E).

Let's think step by step.  This problem involves heat transfer.  We'll use the principle that the heat lost by the alcohol equals the heat gained by the water and the glass container.  The equation for heat transfer is Q = mcΔT, where Q is heat, m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

1. **Heat lost by alcohol:** The alcohol cools from 75°C to 46°C.  Its mass is 500g. Let's denote the specific heat of alcohol as c_alcohol.  So, Q_alcohol = (500g)(c_alcohol)(75°C - 46°C) = 14500c_alcohol cal.

2. **Heat gained by water:** The water warms from 30°C to 46°C.  Its mass is 500g, and the specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C.  So, Q_water = (500g)(1 cal/g°C)(46°C - 30°C) = 8000 cal.

3. **Heat gained by glass container:** The glass warms from 30°C to 46°C.  Its mass is 300g, and its specific heat is 0.14 cal/g°C. So, Q_glass = (300g)(0.14 cal/g°C)(46°C - 30°C) = 672 cal.


4. **Equating heat transfer:**  The heat lost by the alcohol equals the heat gained by the water and the glass:

   14500c_alcohol = 8000 + 672

   14500c_alcohol = 8672

   c_alcohol = 8672 / 14500 

   c_alcohol ≈ 0.598 cal/g°C


Therefore, the specific heat of alcohol is approximately 0.598 cal/g°C.

The answer is (E)

To determine the specific heat of alcohol when mixed with water and contained in a glass container, we can utilize the principle of conservation of energy, where the heat lost by the alcohol equals the heat gained by the water and the glass container.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Known Values**:
   - Mass of alcohol (\(m_{alcohol}\)) = 500 g
   - Initial temperature of alcohol (\(T_{i,alcohol}\)) = 75°C
   - Final temperature of the mixture (\(T_f\)) = 46°C
   - Mass of water (\(m_{water}\)) = 500 g
   - Initial temperature of water (\(T_{i,water}\)) = 30°C
   - Specific heat of water (\(c_{water}\)) = 1 cal/g°C
   - Mass of glass (\(m_{glass}\)) = 300 g
   - Specific heat of glass (\(c_{glass}\)) = 0.14 cal/g°C

2. **Calculate Temperature Changes**:
   - Change in temperature for alcohol (\(\Delta T_{alcohol}\)) = \(T_f - T_{i,alcohol} = 46°C - 75°C = -29°C\)
   - Change in temperature for water and glass (\(\Delta T_{water}\) and \(\Delta T_{glass}\)) = \(T_f - T_{i,water} = 46°C - 30°C = 16°C\)

3. **Set Up the Heat Exchange Equation**:
   The heat lost by the alcohol is equal to the total heat gained by the water and the glass:
   \[
   Q_{lost, alcohol} + Q_{gained, water} + Q_{gained, glass} = 0
   \]
   This expands to:
   \[
   m_{alcohol} \cdot c_{alcohol} \cdot \Delta T_{alcohol} + m_{water} \cdot c_{water} \cdot \Delta T_{water} + m_{glass} \cdot c_{glass} \cdot \Delta T_{glass} = 0
   \]

4. **Plugging the Known Values**:
   Substituting the known values into our equation:
   \[
   (500 \cdot c_{alcohol} \cdot -29) + (500 \cdot 1 \cdot 16) + (300 \cdot 0.14 \cdot 16) = 0
   \]

5. **Calculate Each Heat Term**:
   - Heat gained by water:
     \[
     Q_{water} = 500 \cdot 1 \cdot 16 = 8000 \, \text{cal}
     \]
   - Heat gained by the glass:
     \[
     Q_{glass} = 300 \cdot 0.14 \cdot 16 = 672 \, \text{cal}
     \]

6. **Total Heat Gained**:
   \[
   Q_{gained} = 8000 + 672 = 8672 \, \text{cal}
   \]

7. **Heat Lost by Alcohol**:
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   -500 \cdot c_{alcohol} \cdot 29 = -8672
   \]

8. **Solving for Specific Heat of Alcohol**:
   \[
   c_{alcohol} = \frac{8672}{500 \cdot 29}
   \]
   Calculating this gives:
   \[
   c_{alcohol} \approx 0.597 \, \text{cal/g°C}
   \]

Finally, upon reviewing the provided options, the closest answer to our calculation is:
- **E. 0.598 cal/g°C**

In conclusion, based on the analysis, the final answer is:
The answer is (E).

Let's think step by step.  This problem uses the principle of conservation of energy: the heat lost by the alcohol equals the heat gained by the water and the glass. The formula for heat transfer is Q = mcΔT, where Q is heat (in calories), m is mass (in grams), c is specific heat (in cal/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).

1. **Heat lost by alcohol:** Q_alcohol = (500 g)(c_alcohol)(75°C - 46°C) = 14500c_alcohol cal

2. **Heat gained by water:** Q_water = (500 g)(1 cal/g°C)(46°C - 30°C) = 8000 cal

3. **Heat gained by glass:** Q_glass = (300 g)(0.14 cal/g°C)(46°C - 30°C) = 672 cal

4. **Equating heat transfer:** 14500c_alcohol = 8000 + 672  =>  14500c_alcohol = 8672  => c_alcohol = 8672 / 14500 ≈ 0.598 cal/g°C

Therefore, the specific heat of the alcohol is approximately 0.598 cal/g°C.

The answer is (E).
