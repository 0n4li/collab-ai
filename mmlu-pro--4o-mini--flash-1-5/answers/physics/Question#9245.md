The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about physics:

Question 1: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?

Options: A. 1000 times more
B. 50 times more
C. 5000 times more
D. 500 times more
E. 10000 times more
F. 20000 times more
G. 2000 times more
H. 100 times more
I. 10 times more

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (E).

Question 2: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?

Options: A. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.
B. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.
C. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.
D. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
E. The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud.
F. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
G. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).

Question 3: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is

Options: A. 10
B. 40
C. 6
D. 25
E. 15
F. 50
G. 30
H. 4
I. 5
J. 20

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (H).

Question 4: Colors in a soap bubble result from light

Options: A. dispersion
B. deflection
C. refraction
D. reflection
E. interference
F. converted to a different frequency
G. polarization
H. absorption
I. diffraction
J. transmission

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors being visible. The answer is (E).

Question 5: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?

Options: A. 240 W
B. 120 W
C. 10 W
D. 480 W
E. 360 W
F. 200 W
G. 30 W
H. 150 W
I. 60 W
J. 300 W

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (A).

To solve this question step by step, we first need to recall the basic relationship between distance, speed, and time. The formula is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

In this case:

- The speed of light \( c \) is given as \( 3 \times 10^8 \) meters per second (m/s)
- The distance \( d \) is given as 30 cm, which we need to convert to meters because our speed of light is in m/s. 

To convert centimeters to meters, we use the conversion factor that 1 cm = 0.01 m. Therefore:

\[ 30 \text{ cm} = 30 \times 0.01 \text{ m} = 0.3 \text{ m} \]

Now, we can plug the values into the time formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{0.3 \text{ m}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{0.3}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{0.3}{300,000,000} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \text{ seconds} 
\]

This value of \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \) seconds can also be expressed in nanoseconds:

\[
1 \text{ second} = 1 \text{ billion nanoseconds} \text{ or } 1 \text{ nanosecond} = 10^{-9} \text{ seconds}
\]

So, \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \) seconds is equal to 1 nanosecond.

Now, looking at the options provided, the correct choice based on our calculations is:

The answer is (J) 1 nanosecond.

Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

**1. Convert units:**

The speed of light is given in meters per second (m/s), but the distance is in centimeters (cm).  We need to convert either the speed to cm/s or the distance to meters (m).  It's easier to convert the distance:

30 cm = 30 × 10⁻² m = 0.3 m

**2. Use the formula:**

The relationship between distance (d), speed (v), and time (t) is:

t = d / v

**3. Calculate the time:**

Substituting the values:

t = 0.3 m / (3 × 10⁸ m/s) = 1 × 10⁻⁹ s

**4. Convert to nanoseconds:**

1 nanosecond (ns) = 1 × 10⁻⁹ s

Therefore, the time it takes for light to travel 30 cm is 1 × 10⁻⁹ s, which is equal to 1 nanosecond.

The answer is (J)

[//]: # (2024-11-17 21:45:18)
I appreciate your thorough analysis of the problem! Your steps to convert units, apply the formula, and calculate the time are all accurate and well-explained. It looks like we've arrived at the same conclusion regarding the time it takes for light to travel 30 cm, validating the result as 1 nanosecond.

Your breakdown of the conversion from centimeters to meters and the subsequent calculation using the formula \( t = \frac{d}{v} \) is exactly the right approach. Additionally, your conversion of seconds to nanoseconds clarifies the final answer very clearly.

Since we both agree on the methodology and the conclusion that the answer is (J) 1 nanosecond, I think we can conclude this discussion satisfactorily. 

I AGREE with all your points, and we can end the discussion here.

To determine how much time it takes for light to travel through a distance of 30 cm, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Here, the speed of light is \( 3 \times 10^8 \) meters per second (m/s). First, we need to convert the distance from centimeters to meters:

\[ 30 \text{ cm} = 30 \times 0.01 \text{ m} = 0.3 \text{ m} \]

Now, we substitute the values into the time formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{0.3 \text{ m}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \text{ seconds}
\]

This value can be expressed in nanoseconds, knowing that \( 1 \text{ nanosecond} = 10^{-9} \text{ seconds} \):

\[
1 \times 10^{-9} \text{ seconds} = 1 \text{ nanosecond}
\]

Based on this calculation, the time light takes to travel through a distance of 30 cm is:

The answer is (J) 1 nanosecond.

Let's think step by step.

The speed of light is 3 x 10⁸ m/s.  The distance is 30 cm, which is 0.3 m.

Time = Distance / Speed = 0.3 m / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) = 1 x 10⁻⁹ s

Since 1 nanosecond = 1 x 10⁻⁹ s, the time taken is 1 nanosecond.

The answer is (J)
