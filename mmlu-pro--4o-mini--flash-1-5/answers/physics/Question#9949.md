The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about physics:

Question 1: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?

Options: A. 1000 times more
B. 50 times more
C. 5000 times more
D. 500 times more
E. 10000 times more
F. 20000 times more
G. 2000 times more
H. 100 times more
I. 10 times more

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (E).

Question 2: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?

Options: A. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.
B. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.
C. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.
D. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
E. The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud.
F. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
G. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).

Question 3: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is

Options: A. 10
B. 40
C. 6
D. 25
E. 15
F. 50
G. 30
H. 4
I. 5
J. 20

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (H).

Question 4: Colors in a soap bubble result from light

Options: A. dispersion
B. deflection
C. refraction
D. reflection
E. interference
F. converted to a different frequency
G. polarization
H. absorption
I. diffraction
J. transmission

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors being visible. The answer is (E).

Question 5: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?

Options: A. 240 W
B. 120 W
C. 10 W
D. 480 W
E. 360 W
F. 200 W
G. 30 W
H. 150 W
I. 60 W
J. 300 W

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (A).

To determine the stopping potential when light of wavelength 400 nm is incident upon lithium, we will use the principles of the photoelectric effect. The steps involved are as follows:

1. **Convert Wavelength to Energy**: First, we need to find the energy of the incident photons using the wavelength. The energy of a photon \(E\) is given by the formula: 

   \[
   E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]

   where:
   - \(h\) (Planck's constant) = \(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J}\cdot\text{s}\) 
   - \(c\) (speed of light) = \(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)
   - \(\lambda\) = 400 nm = \(400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\)

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J}\cdot\text{s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}} 
   \]

   Computing this gives:

   \[
   E = \frac{(1.9878 \times 10^{-25})}{400 \times 10^{-9}} = 4.9695 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Convert Energy to eV**: Since the work function \(\phi\) is given in electron volts, we need to convert the energy from joules to eV. The conversion is:

   \[
   1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

   Therefore:

   \[
   E = \frac{4.9695 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 3.10 \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **Calculate Stopping Potential**: The stopping potential \(V_0\) can be calculated using the equation:

   \[
   eV_0 = E - \phi
   \]

   where \(\phi\) is the work function of lithium, given as \(2.93 \, \text{eV}\). Thus, substituting in the values:

   \[
   eV_0 = 3.10 \, \text{eV} - 2.93 \, \text{eV} = 0.17 \, \text{eV}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: Hence, the stopping potential is \(0.17 \, \text{V}\).

Considering the available options, the answer is: 

The answer is (H).

Okay, let's tackle this photoelectric effect problem step-by-step.  We need to find the stopping potential, which is the voltage needed to stop the emitted electrons.

**1. Convert wavelength to energy:**

First, we need to convert the wavelength of the light (400 nm) into energy. We can use the following equation:

E = hc/λ

where:

* E is the energy of the photon
* h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)
* c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)
* λ is the wavelength (400 nm = 400 x 10^-9 m)

Plugging in the values:

E = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (400 x 10^-9 m) 
E ≈ 4.97 x 10^-19 J

Now, let's convert this energy from Joules to electron volts (eV):

E (eV) = E (J) / 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV
E (eV) ≈ 3.10 eV

**2. Calculate the kinetic energy of emitted electrons:**

The kinetic energy (KE) of the emitted electrons is the difference between the energy of the incident photon and the work function (Φ) of the lithium:

KE = E - Φ
KE = 3.10 eV - 2.93 eV
KE ≈ 0.17 eV

**3. Determine the stopping potential:**

The stopping potential (V_stop) is the voltage required to stop the electrons with kinetic energy KE.  The relationship is:

KE = eV_stop

where:

* e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)

Solving for V_stop:

V_stop = KE / e
Since KE is already in eV, and e is implicitly 1 in eV units,  V_stop ≈ 0.17 V

Therefore, based on these calculations:

The answer is (H)

I appreciate your thorough breakdown of the problem and the methodology used to arrive at the stopping potential. Your steps are clear, and your calculations align with the principles of the photoelectric effect accurately. Let’s delve into your points one by one.

1. **Wavelength to Energy Conversion**: Your calculations for the energy of the photon from the given wavelength are spot on. You've correctly applied the formula \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\) and obtained the energy in both joules and electron volts. The conversion process is well-articulated, and your final energy value of approximately 3.10 eV is correct.

2. **Kinetic Energy Calculation**: Your approach to finding the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons by subtracting the work function from the incident photon energy is precisely how it should be done. You correctly deduce that the kinetic energy comes out to be approximately 0.17 eV.

3. **Stopping Potential Determination**: Your conclusion about the stopping potential being equal to the kinetic energy is appropriate, and your final calculation shows that the stopping potential is approximately 0.17 V.

I have no disagreements with your analysis and calculations. Your conclusion is accurate and aligns with my findings. The stopping potential is indeed 0.17 V, corresponding to option (H).

Thus, I AGREE with all your points, and I think we've reached a solid conclusion!

To calculate the stopping potential for light of wavelength 400 nm incident on lithium with a work function (\(\phi\)) of 2.93 eV, we will follow the principles of the photoelectric effect:

1. **Convert Wavelength to Energy**: 
   The energy (\(E\)) of a photon is given by the formula:
   \[
   E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where:
   - \(h\) (Planck's constant) = \(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J}\cdot\text{s}\)
   - \(c\) (speed of light) = \(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)
   - \(\lambda\) = 400 nm = \(400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\)

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J}\cdot\text{s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}} 
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   E \approx 4.97 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Convert Energy to eV**:
   Convert energy from joules to electron volts using:
   \[
   1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   E \approx \frac{4.97 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 3.10 \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Kinetic Energy**:
   The kinetic energy (KE) of the emitted electrons is given by:
   \[
   KE = E - \phi
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   KE \approx 3.10 \, \text{eV} - 2.93 \, \text{eV} \approx 0.17 \, \text{eV}
   \]

4. **Determine the Stopping Potential**:
   The stopping potential (\(V\)) is equivalent to the kinetic energy in volts. Therefore:
   \[
   V \approx 0.17 \, \text{V}
   \]

Based on the calculations, the stopping potential is 0.17 V, corresponding to option (H).

The answer is (H).

Let's think step by step.

1. **Convert Wavelength to Energy:**  The energy of a photon (E) is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength (400 nm = 400 x 10^-9 m).  Calculating this gives E ≈ 4.97 x 10^-19 J.  Converting to electron volts (eV) using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, we get E ≈ 3.10 eV.

2. **Calculate Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy (KE) of the emitted electrons is the difference between the photon energy and the work function (Φ) of lithium: KE = E - Φ = 3.10 eV - 2.93 eV = 0.17 eV.

3. **Determine Stopping Potential:** The stopping potential (V_stop) is the voltage needed to stop the electrons, and it's related to the kinetic energy by KE = eV_stop, where e is the elementary charge.  Since KE is already in eV, V_stop ≈ 0.17 V.

The answer is (H).
