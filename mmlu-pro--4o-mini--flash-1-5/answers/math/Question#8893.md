The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about math:

Question 1: The symmetric group $S_n$ has $
\factorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.
Find the characteristic of the ring 2Z.

Options: 
A. 0
B. 30
C. 3
D. 10
E. 12
F. 50
G. 2
H. 100
I. 20
J. 5

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).

Question 2: Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?

Options: 
A. ST + TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
B. TS = 0
C. ST = 1
D. ST - TS = 0
E. ST = T
F. ST = 0
G. ST = TS
H. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
I. TS = T
J. ST = S

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. For a given polynomial $p$ we have
\[ST(p) = (xp(x))’ = p(x) + xp’(x)\]
and
\[TS(p) = xp’(x).\]
Hence \[ST(p) - TS(p) = p(x) + xp’(x) - xp’(x).\] The answer is (H).

Question 3: Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \in A}?

Options: 
A. -5
B. 0
C. -3
D. -7
E. -4
F. -6
G. -1
H. -2
I. -9

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$. The answer is (E).

Question 4: A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?

Options: 
A. 3 + e^-2
B. 2 - e^-4
C. 2 - e^-2
D. 3 + e^-4
E. 2 + e^-3
F. 2 - e^-3
G. 3 - e^-2
H. 2 + e^-2
I. 2 + e^-4
J. 2

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$
\frac{d}{d t}[\ln (s-2)]=\frac{s^{\prime}}{s-2}=\frac{-1}{25}=\frac{d}{d t}\left[-\frac{t}{25}ight] .
$$
Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$. The answer is (I).

Question 5: A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?

Options: 
A. Multiply 5 by 5 to find 25 teams.
B. Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.
C. Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.
D. Subtract 30 from 5 to find -25 teams.
E. Divide 5 by 30 to find 0.1667 teams.
F. Add 5 to 30 then divide by 2 to find 17.5 teams.

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We want to find the number of teams. We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players. Thus to get the number of teams we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6 teams. The answer is (B).

ANALYSIS:
The question asks us to identify the step that explains how to isolate the variable \( a \) in the equation \( 6a = 72 \). To solve for \( a \), we need to perform an operation that will get \( a \) by itself on one side of the equation.

1. **Understanding the Equation**: 
   We start with the equation \( 6a = 72 \). Here, \( 6 \) is multiplying \( a \).

2. **Goal**: 
   Our goal is to solve for \( a \), which means we want to express \( a \) in terms of another number. 

3. **Solving the Equation**: 
   To isolate \( a \), we need to eliminate the coefficient \( 6 \) that is multiplying \( a \). The most straightforward way to do this is to divide both sides of the equation by \( 6 \). 
   - If we divide both sides by \( 6 \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{6a}{6} = \frac{72}{6}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives us:
   \[
   a = 12
   \]

4. **Evaluating the Options**:
   Let's evaluate each option to check which one fits our step:
   - **A. divide both sides by 6**: This is indeed the correct step as described above.
   - **B. multiply both sides by 6**: This would make the equation \( 36a = 432 \), which does not help to solve for \( a \).
   - **C. add 6 to 72**: This does not relate to isolating \( a \).
   - **D. add 6 to both sides**: This also does not help with isolating \( a \).
   - **E. subtract 72 from both sides**: This would result in \( 6a - 72 = 0 \), which is not helpful for finding \( a \).
   - **F. add 72 to both sides**: This also does not assist in isolating \( a \).
   - **G. divide both sides by 72**: This does not help in isolating \( a \).
   - **H. multiply both sides by 72**: This makes the equation unnecessarily complicated.
   - **I. subtract 6 from 72**: This does not relate to the operation to isolate \( a \).
   - **J. subtract 6 from both sides**: This is not applicable for isolating \( a \).

5. **Conclusion for Options**: The only option that correctly describes how to isolate \( a \) in the equation \( 6a = 72 \) is option **A**.

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (A).

Okay, let's analyze this question together.  The question asks us to identify the correct step to solve the equation 6a = 72 for 'a'.  We need to isolate 'a' on one side of the equation.

**Analysis:**

The equation is 6a = 72.  'a' is being multiplied by 6. To isolate 'a', we need to perform the inverse operation, which is division.

Let's examine each option:

* **A. divide both sides by 6:** This is the correct approach. Dividing both sides by 6 gives us a = 72/6 = 12.

* **B. multiply both sides by 6:** This would make the equation 36a = 432, further complicating things. Incorrect.

* **C. add 6 to 72:** This would give 78, not solving for 'a'. Incorrect.

* **D. add 6 to both sides:** This would give 6a + 6 = 78, not solving for 'a'. Incorrect.

* **E. subtract 72 from both sides:** This would give 6a - 72 = 0, not solving for 'a'. Incorrect.

* **F. add 72 to both sides:** This would give 6a + 72 = 144, not solving for 'a'. Incorrect.

* **G. divide both sides by 72:** This would give a/12 = 1, which is incorrect.

* **H. multiply both sides by 72:** This would give 432a = 5184, further complicating things. Incorrect.

* **I. subtract 6 from 72:** This would give 66, not solving for 'a'. Incorrect.

* **J. subtract 6 from both sides:** This would give 6a - 6 = 66, not solving for 'a'. Incorrect.


**Conclusion:**

The answer is (A)
