### openai/gpt-4o-mini Initial Response:

To start, let's calculate the total cost of the meals that John Cowan and his family had. We can add together the individual amounts they spent:

1. $6.75
2. $5.50
3. $2.35
4. $1.95

Now, let’s add these together:

- First, add $6.75 and $5.50:
  \[
  6.75 + 5.50 = 12.25
  \]

- Next, add $12.25 and $2.35:
  \[
  12.25 + 2.35 = 14.60
  \]

- Finally, add $14.60 and $1.95:
  \[
  14.60 + 1.95 = 16.55
  \]

So, the total cost of the meals before tax is **$16.55**. 

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax, which is 3% of this amount. To do that, we can multiply $16.55 by 0.03:

\[
16.55 \times 0.03 = 0.4965
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the sales tax would be approximately **$0.50**.

Now, we add this tax to the total cost to find out the total amount paid:

\[
16.55 + 0.50 = 17.05
\]

So, if John Cowan and his family paid for all the meals on one check, they paid **$17.05**.

Now, let's consider the case where separate checks were issued. Each meal would still incur the same sales tax rate of 3%. However, each meal's sales tax amount will be calculated separately. The total sum of sales tax due for each meal can actually be less than the sales tax calculated on the total.

Calculating tax separately for each meal:

1. Sales tax on $6.75:
   \[
   6.75 \times 0.03 = 0.2025 \rightarrow \text{rounded } = 0.20
   \]
   
2. Sales tax on $5.50:
   \[
   5.50 \times 0.03 = 0.165 \rightarrow \text{rounded } = 0.17
   \]
   
3. Sales tax on $2.35:
   \[
   2.35 \times 0.03 = 0.0705 \rightarrow \text{rounded } = 0.07
   \]
   
4. Sales tax on $1.95:
   \[
   1.95 \times 0.03 = 0.0585 \rightarrow \text{rounded } = 0.06
   \]

Now, let's add these sales taxes together:

- Total sales tax:
  \[
  0.20 + 0.17 + 0.07 + 0.06 = 0.50
  \]

Adding this to the cost when checks were separate, gives:
\[
16.55 (total meals) + 0.50 (tax) = 17.05
\]

Interestingly, whether they paid on one check or separate checks, they would pay the same total amount of **$17.05**.

Now, I can find the option that matches this total in the provided choices:

- A. $18.55
- B. $17.55
- C. $15.05
- D. $16.75
- E. $17.25
- F. $16.95
- G. $17.05
- H. $16.55
- I. $15.55
- J. $18.05

The answer that aligns with our calculations is **G**.

Thus, the answer is (G).

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total pre-tax cost.**

First, we need to find the total cost of the meals before tax.  We add up the individual meal costs:

$6.75 + $5.50 + $2.35 + $1.95 = $16.55

**Step 2: Calculate the sales tax.**

The sales tax is 3% of the total pre-tax cost. To calculate this, we multiply the total cost by 0.03:

$16.55 * 0.03 = $0.4965

Since we're dealing with money, we round this to the nearest cent: $0.50

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost with tax (single check).**

Finally, we add the sales tax to the pre-tax cost:

$16.55 + $0.50 = $17.05

Therefore, they paid $17.05 with one check.


**Step 4: Calculate the total cost with separate checks.**

If they had separate checks, the sales tax would be calculated for each meal individually. However, the question implies that the sales tax rate remains the same (3%).  This means that the total amount paid would remain the same as each check would add up to the same final total.

Let's calculate this explicitly:

Meal 1 tax: $6.75 * 0.03 = $0.2025 ≈ $0.20
Meal 2 tax: $5.50 * 0.03 = $0.165 ≈ $0.17
Meal 3 tax: $2.35 * 0.03 = $0.0705 ≈ $0.07
Meal 4 tax: $1.95 * 0.03 = $0.0585 ≈ $0.06

Total tax with separate checks: $0.20 + $0.17 + $0.07 + $0.06 = $0.50

Total cost with separate checks: $16.55 + $0.50 = $17.05

The total cost remains the same, whether a single check or separate checks are used.


**Conclusion:**

The answer is (G). They paid $17.05, regardless of whether they used one check or separate checks.

The answer is (G)

I appreciate your detailed breakdown of the problem, and you've covered each step quite well. Let’s review the key points and clarify everything thoroughly.

1. **Calculating Total Pre-Tax Cost**: You correctly summed up the meal costs to $16.55. This computation is clear and accurate.

2. **Calculating Sales Tax**: Your calculation of sales tax as 3% of the pre-tax total is spot-on. This yielded a rounded tax of $0.50, which is appropriate considering the context of the problem. 

3. **Calculating Total Cost with Tax for a Single Check**: Adding the sales tax to the pre-tax total to arrive at $17.05 is done correctly. This is the total amount they would have paid on one check.

4. **Separate Checks Calculation**: You also correctly pointed out that whether the checks are separate or combined, the total tax accumulated is the same—$0.50—and thus, the overall expense remains consistent at $17.05. 

I believe we both agree on the calculations and conclusions here, and I find your reasoning solid. Your final conclusion matches the result of my own calculations, affirming that they would pay **$17.05** regardless of whether it was on one check or multiple checks. 

With that said, I would like to confirm that I AGREE with all your points, and as such, I think we can conclude our discussion on this topic.

I agree with your assessment and your step-by-step breakdown of the problem.  Your explanation is clear, concise, and accurate.  I especially appreciate your detailed justification for the separate checks scenario, clarifying why the total remains the same despite the individual tax calculations. My approach was essentially the same, arriving at the same conclusion.  There are no points of disagreement I could raise.

I AGREE with all your points and the discussion can be concluded.

Thank you for your thoughtful feedback. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the clarity and detail in my breakdown of the problem. Your points have provided a solid reinforcement of the conclusions we reached. 

1. **Agreement on Calculations**: We're aligned on the calculations throughout, with both of us arriving at the total pre-tax cost of $16.55, the sales tax of $0.50, and the ultimate total of $17.05.

2. **Clarification on Separate Checks**: I also value how you emphasized that the total cost doesn’t change despite separate checks, as the sum of taxes still amounts to the same figure when processed individually.

Given this consensus on both the process and conclusions, I find no discrepancies or areas of disagreement in your assessment. Your perspective aligns well with mine, and I see no need for further debate on this topic. 

Therefore, I can confidently say that I AGREE with all your points, and I think we can conclude our discussion here. Thank you for your collaborative approach!

Let's analyze the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total amount spent on meals. The meals cost were as follows:
- $6.75
- $5.50
- $2.35
- $1.95

Adding these amounts, we have:
\[
6.75 + 5.50 + 2.35 + 1.95 = 16.55
\]

Next, we need to calculate the sales tax, which is 3%. To find this, we multiply the total meal cost by 0.03:
\[
16.55 \times 0.03 = 0.4965
\]
Rounding this amount to the nearest cent gives us a sales tax of approximately $0.50.

Now, we calculate the total amount paid by adding the sales tax to the total meal cost:
\[
16.55 + 0.50 = 17.05
\]

This means that if John and his family paid for all the meals on one check, they would pay **$17.05**.

If separate checks had been issued, the individual sales tax for each meal would still total the same amount of $0.50:
1. Sales tax on $6.75: 
   \[
   6.75 \times 0.03 \approx 0.20
   \]
2. Sales tax on $5.50:
   \[
   5.50 \times 0.03 \approx 0.17
   \]
3. Sales tax on $2.35:
   \[
   2.35 \times 0.03 \approx 0.07
   \]
4. Sales tax on $1.95:
   \[
   1.95 \times 0.03 \approx 0.06
   \]

When we add these individual sales taxes:
\[
0.20 + 0.17 + 0.07 + 0.06 = 0.50
\]

Since the total cost plus the tax remains the same at $17.05 both when using one check or separate checks, we conclude that they would pay **$17.05** in either case.

The answer is (G) $17.05.

Therefore, John Cowan and his family paid $17.05.

The answer is (G)
