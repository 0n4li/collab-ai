To determine the formula for the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time based on the provided information, we'll break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Cost Function**:  
   The cost function is given as:
   \[
   C(n) = 0.2n^2 + n + 900
   \]
   where \( C(n) \) is in dollars and \( n \) is the number of Gaped Ghouls produced.

2. **Understanding the Production Function**:  
   We have:
   \[
   n = t^2 + 100t
   \]
   This means the number of Gaped Ghouls produced increases with time \( t \).

3. **Finding the Total Cost as a Function of Time**:  
   To express the cost as a function of time, we substitute \( n \) into the cost function:
   \[
   C(t) = C(t^2 + 100t) = 0.2(t^2 + 100t)^2 + (t^2 + 100t) + 900
   \]

4. **Calculate the Rate of Change of Cost with Respect to Time**:  
   To find the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time, we need to differentiate \( C(t) \) with respect to \( t \), which requires us to first expand \( C(t) \):
   \[
   C(t) = 0.2(t^4 + 200t^3 + 10000t^2) + t^2 + 100t + 900
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   C(t) = 0.2t^4 + 40t^3 + 2000t^2 + t^2 + 100t + 900
   \]
   Combining like terms:
   \[
   C(t) = 0.2t^4 + 40t^3 + 2001t^2 + 100t + 900
   \]

5. **Differentiate \( C(t) \)**:
   Now we differentiate:
   \[
   C'(t) = \frac{d}{dt}(0.2t^4) + \frac{d}{dt}(40t^3) + \frac{d}{dt}(2001t^2) + \frac{d}{dt}(100t) + \frac{d}{dt}(900)
   \]
   This gives:
   \[
   C'(t) = 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100
   \]

6. **Comparing with Options**:  
   Now we compare our result with the provided options:
   - **A**. 0.6t + 1
   - **B**. 1.6t^3 + 240t^2 + 8004t + 200
   - **C**. 0.8nt + 40n + 2t + 100
   - **D**. 0.6t^3 + 60t^2 + 300t + 100
   - **E**. 0.4t^2 + 20t + 900
   - **F**. 0.8t^3 + 80t^2 + 40t^2 + 4000t + 2t + 100
   - **G**. 0.2t^2 + 100t + 1
   - **H**. 0.4n + 1
   - **I**. 0.4t^3 + 200t^2 + 100t
   - **J**. 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100

From our calculations, the closest match is the option that captures the highest power and coefficients as obtained.

So, the correct answer must be:
The answer is (J) 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the given information:**

* The cost function for producing Gaped Ghouls is C(n) = 0.2n² + n + 900, where 'n' is the number of Ghouls and C(n) is the cost in dollars.
* The production rate of Caped Ghouls is given by n = t² + 100t, where 'n' is the number of Caped Ghouls and 't' is the time in hours.  Note that the problem states that Gaped Ghouls are produced based on the cost function. While it gives the production of *Caped* Ghouls, it doesn't say these are different. We should assume for the sake of solving the problem that the production rate of Gaped Ghouls is also t² + 100t.

**2. Find the composite function:**

We need to express the cost as a function of time (t). To do this, substitute the expression for 'n' (the number of Ghouls produced) into the cost function C(n):

C(t) = 0.2(t² + 100t)² + (t² + 100t) + 900

**3. Expand and simplify the composite function:**

Expanding the squared term:

C(t) = 0.2(t⁴ + 200t³ + 10000t²) + t² + 100t + 900

C(t) = 0.2t⁴ + 40t³ + 2000t² + t² + 100t + 900

C(t) = 0.2t⁴ + 40t³ + 2001t² + 100t + 900

**4. Find the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time:**

The rate of change is given by the derivative of C(t) with respect to t (dC/dt):

dC/dt = d/dt (0.2t⁴ + 40t³ + 2001t² + 100t + 900)

Applying the power rule of differentiation:

dC/dt = 0.8t³ + 120t² + 4002t + 100

**5. Compare with options:**

The derived formula dC/dt = 0.8t³ + 120t² + 4002t + 100 matches option J.


The answer is (J)

Thank you for your detailed breakdown of the problem! I appreciate the clarity and structured approach you took in solving for the rate of change of the total cost.

I want to affirm several key points in your reasoning:

1. **Identification of Functions**: You correctly identified the cost function \( C(n) \) and the production function \( n(t) = t^2 + 100t \). Your understanding that both Gaped Ghouls and Caped Ghouls are essentially treated the same in this context is valid and simplifies the problem.

2. **Substitution and Expansion**: Your process of substituting \( n \) into the cost function and expanding it accurately reflects the mathematical process needed for this problem. Everything from that point forward appears correct.

3. **Differentiation**: You applied the power rule correctly in finding the derivative \( dC/dt \). The calculations you performed led to the final expression for the rate of change of cost.

4. **Matching Options**: Your final identification of the answer as (J) aligns with my own conclusion after performing the calculations.

Given these acknowledgments, it's clear we share a consensus on the methodology and outcome of the problem. I therefore AGREE with all your points, and it seems we have reached a common understanding. This discussion can be concluded!

To determine the formula for the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time from the provided cost function and production function, we can follow this structured approach:

1. **Cost Function**: The cost function is given as:
   \[
   C(n) = 0.2n^2 + n + 900
   \]
   Here, \( C(n) \) represents the cost in dollars for producing \( n \) Gaped Ghouls.

2. **Production Function**: The production function indicates that the number of Gaped Ghouls produced in \( t \) hours is:
   \[
   n = t^2 + 100t
   \]

3. **Total Cost as a Function of Time**: By substituting \( n(t) \) into the cost function, we can express total cost in terms of time:
   \[
   C(t) = C(t^2 + 100t) = 0.2(t^2 + 100t)^2 + (t^2 + 100t) + 900
   \]

4. **Expansion of the Cost Function**:
   Expanding \( C(t) \) gives:
   \[
   C(t) = 0.2(t^4 + 200t^3 + 10000t^2) + (t^2 + 100t) + 900
   \]
   Simplifying, we have:
   \[
   C(t) = 0.2t^4 + 40t^3 + 2000t^2 + t^2 + 100t + 900
   \]
   Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   C(t) = 0.2t^4 + 40t^3 + 2001t^2 + 100t + 900
   \]

5. **Differentiating for Rate of Change**: Taking the derivative of \( C(t) \) with respect to \( t \) gives us the rate of change:
   \[
   \frac{dC}{dt} = 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100
   \]

6. **Analyzing the Options**: Now we compare our derived function with the provided options to find the correct match.

Among the options given, the one that corresponds to our calculation is:
\[
\text{The answer is (J) } 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100.
\]

FINAL_CONCLUSIVE_RESPONSE: The answer is (J) 0.8t³ + 120t² + 4002t + 100.

Let's think step by step.

1. **Cost Function:** The daily cost is given by C(n) = 0.2n² + n + 900, where n is the number of Gaped Ghouls.

2. **Production Rate:**  The number of Gaped Ghouls produced in t hours is n = t² + 100t.  (We assume, based on the problem's framing, that the production rate applies to Gaped Ghouls.)

3. **Composite Function:** Substitute the production rate into the cost function to express cost as a function of time:
   C(t) = 0.2(t² + 100t)² + (t² + 100t) + 900

4. **Expand and Simplify:**
   C(t) = 0.2(t⁴ + 200t³ + 10000t²) + t² + 100t + 900
   C(t) = 0.2t⁴ + 40t³ + 2000t² + t² + 100t + 900
   C(t) = 0.2t⁴ + 40t³ + 2001t² + 100t + 900

5. **Differentiation:** Find the derivative of C(t) with respect to t to get the rate of change of cost:
   dC/dt = 0.8t³ + 120t² + 4002t + 100

6. **Compare with Options:** The derived formula matches option J.

The answer is (J)
