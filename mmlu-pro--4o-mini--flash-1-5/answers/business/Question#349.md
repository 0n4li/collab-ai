To find the dollar markup on the stereo system, we can follow this step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Selling Price and Cost**: 
   - Selling Price (SP) = $200
   - Cost Price (CP) = $120 

2. **Understand the Concept of Markup**: 
   - Markup is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Markup} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Markup**:
   - Plugging in the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Markup} = 200 - 120 = 80
     \]

4. **Identify the Correct Option**: 
   - From the options provided, we can see that the dollar markup we calculated is $80. The corresponding option is:
     A. $80.00

Putting it all together, the answer to the question regarding the dollar markup on the stereo system is that the markup is $80.00.

Thus, The answer is (A).

Okay, let's tackle this question.  We need to find the dollar markup on a stereo system.  The problem gives us two key pieces of information:

* **Selling Price:** $200
* **Cost to the Store:** $120

The dollar markup is simply the difference between the selling price and the cost price. To calculate this, we subtract the cost to the store from the selling price:

Dollar Markup = Selling Price - Cost to Store
Dollar Markup = $200 - $120
Dollar Markup = $80

Therefore, the dollar markup is $80.00.

The answer is (A).
