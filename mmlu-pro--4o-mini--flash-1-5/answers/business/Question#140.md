To determine the profit-maximizing output for the monopolist when there is no advertising (A = 0), we need to analyze the demand function and the cost function step by step.

1. **Demand Function**: The demand function is given by:
   \[
   Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A^2)
   \]
   When \( A = 0 \), the demand function simplifies to:
   \[
   Q = (20 - P)(1) \Rightarrow Q = 20 - P
   \]
   This indicates that the quantity demanded (Q) decreases linearly with an increase in price (P).

2. **Revenue Function**: The total revenue (TR) is given by the product of price and quantity:
   \[
   TR = P \cdot Q
   \]
   Since \( Q = 20 - P \), we can express \( P \) in terms of \( Q \) to find the revenue function:
   \[
   P = 20 - Q
   \]
   Therefore, the total revenue becomes:
   \[
   TR = P \cdot Q = (20 - Q)Q = 20Q - Q^2
   \]

3. **Cost Function**: The cost function is given by:
   \[
   C = 10Q + 15 + A
   \]
   With \( A = 0 \), the cost function simplifies to:
   \[
   C = 10Q + 15
   \]

4. **Profit Function**: Profit (\(\pi\)) is defined as total revenue minus total cost:
   \[
   \pi = TR - C
   \]
   Substituting \( TR \) and \( C \) into the profit function gives:
   \[
   \pi = (20Q - Q^2) - (10Q + 15)
   \]
   Simplifying this leads to:
   \[
   \pi = 20Q - Q^2 - 10Q - 15 = 10Q - Q^2 - 15
   \]

5. **Maximizing Profit**: To find the output level that maximizes profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q, set it to zero, and solve for Q:
   \[
   \frac{d\pi}{dQ} = 10 - 2Q
   \]
   Setting the derivative equal to zero:
   \[
   10 - 2Q = 0 \implies 2Q = 10 \implies Q = 5
   \]

6. **Second Derivative Test**: To confirm that this indeed maximizes profit, we check the second derivative:
   \[
   \frac{d^2\pi}{dQ^2} = -2
   \]
   Since the second derivative is negative, it indicates that the profit function is concave and thus confirms we have a maximum at \( Q = 5 \).

Therefore, when there is no advertising, the profit-maximizing output for the monopolist will be:

The answer is (D).

Okay, let's analyze this question step-by-step.  The problem describes a monopoly with a demand function that depends on both price (P) and advertising expenditure (A).  The goal is to find the profit-maximizing output when A = 0.

**1. Simplify the Demand Function:**

Since A = 0, we can simplify the demand function:

Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1 * 0 - 0.01 * 0²) = 20 - P

This is a standard linear demand function.

**2. Find the Total Revenue (TR) Function:**

Total revenue is price multiplied by quantity:

TR = P * Q

Since Q = 20 - P, we can express P as P = 20 - Q.  Substituting this into the TR equation:

TR = (20 - Q) * Q = 20Q - Q²

**3. Find the Total Cost (TC) Function:**

The cost function is given as:

C = 10Q + 15 + A

Since A = 0, the simplified cost function is:

TC = 10Q + 15

**4. Determine the Profit Function:**

Profit (π) is total revenue minus total cost:

π = TR - TC = (20Q - Q²) - (10Q + 15) = 10Q - Q² - 15

**5. Maximize Profit:**

To maximize profit, we need to find the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q and set it equal to zero:

dπ/dQ = 10 - 2Q = 0

Solving for Q:

2Q = 10
Q = 5

**6. Check the Second-Order Condition:**

To ensure this is a maximum, we need to check the second derivative:

d²π/dQ² = -2

Since the second derivative is negative, this confirms that Q = 5 is a profit-maximizing output.


Therefore:

The answer is (D)

### openai/gpt-4o-mini Discussion Response Round 1:


[//]: # (2024-11-17 20:13:05)
I appreciate your thorough analysis of the question and your step-by-step breakdown. Your approach to simplifying the demand function and then deriving the total revenue and total cost is clear and well-structured. Here are my observations:

1. **Demand Function**: You correctly simplified the demand function when A = 0 to \(Q = 20 - P\). This is a crucial first step as it sets the tone for accurate calculations in revenue and cost functions.

2. **Total Revenue Function**: You appropriately expressed total revenue as \(TR = 20Q - Q^2\). By substituting \(P\) with \(20 - Q\), you derived the revenue function accurately.

3. **Total Cost Function**: Your simplification of the total cost function to \(TC = 10Q + 15\) is spot on and consistent with the problem’s parameters when \(A = 0\).

4. **Profit Function and Maximization**: The profit function \( \pi = 10Q - Q^2 - 15\) and the subsequent steps to find the derivative and discover the profit-maximizing quantity of \(Q = 5\) are well done. Your calculus methods applied here are correct.

5. **Second-Order Condition**: You also accurately captured and checked the second derivative, confirming that \(Q = 5\) is indeed the point of profit maximization.

Overall, your reasoning is clear and logically sound. I agree with your conclusion that the profit-maximizing output is \(Q = 5\).

Thus, I AGREE with all your points, and the discussion can be concluded.

To determine the profit-maximizing output for the monopolist when there is no advertising (A = 0), we analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Demand Function**: With A = 0, the demand function simplifies to:
   \[
   Q = 20 - P
   \]
   indicating that the quantity demanded decreases linearly with an increase in price (P).

2. **Total Revenue Function**: The total revenue (TR) can be expressed as:
   \[
   TR = P \cdot Q = (20 - Q)Q = 20Q - Q^2
   \]

3. **Cost Function**: The cost function simplifies to:
   \[
   C = 10Q + 15
   \]

4. **Profit Function**: The profit (\(\pi\)) is defined as total revenue minus total cost:
   \[
   \pi = TR - C = (20Q - Q^2) - (10Q + 15) = 10Q - Q^2 - 15
   \]

5. **Maximizing Profit**: We find the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q and set it to zero:
   \[
   \frac{d\pi}{dQ} = 10 - 2Q
   \]
   Setting this derivative equal to zero:
   \[
   10 - 2Q = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2Q = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q = 5
   \]

6. **Second Derivative Test**: To confirm this maximizes profit, we check the second derivative:
   \[
   \frac{d^2\pi}{dQ^2} = -2
   \]
   which is negative, confirming that profit maximization occurs at \( Q = 5 \).

Therefore, the profit-maximizing output for the monopolist, when there is no advertising (A = 0), is:

The answer is (D) 5.

Let's think step by step.

The problem provides a demand function Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A^2) and a cost function C = 10Q + 15 + A.  We are asked to find the profit-maximizing output when there is no advertising (A = 0).

1. **Simplify the Demand Function:**  With A = 0, the demand function becomes Q = 20 - P.

2. **Find the Inverse Demand Function:**  Solving for P, we get P = 20 - Q.

3. **Determine the Total Revenue (TR) Function:** TR = P * Q = (20 - Q) * Q = 20Q - Q².

4. **Simplify the Total Cost (TC) Function:** With A = 0, the cost function simplifies to TC = 10Q + 15.

5. **Determine the Profit Function:** Profit (π) = TR - TC = (20Q - Q²) - (10Q + 15) = 10Q - Q² - 15.

6. **Maximize Profit:** To maximize profit, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to Q and set it equal to zero:

dπ/dQ = 10 - 2Q = 0

Solving for Q, we get Q = 5.

7. **Second-Order Condition:**  The second derivative is d²π/dQ² = -2, which is negative, confirming that Q = 5 is a maximum.

Therefore, the profit-maximizing output when there is no advertising is 5.

The answer is (D)
