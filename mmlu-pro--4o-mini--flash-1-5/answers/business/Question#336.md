To solve the question of finding the markup in dollars on $230,000 worth of stock at retail, where the cost is 70% of this selling price, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding Selling Price and Cost**:
   - Selling Price (SP) = $230,000
   - Cost (C) = 70% of the Selling Price

2. **Calculating the Cost**:
   - To find the cost, we multiply the selling price by 70%.
   \[
   C = 0.70 \times SP = 0.70 \times 230,000 = 161,000
   \]

3. **Calculating the Markup**:
   - Markup is calculated as the difference between the Selling Price and the Cost.
   \[
   \text{Markup} = SP - C = 230,000 - 161,000 = 69,000
   \]

4. **Reviewing Options**:
   - Now, letâ€™s look at the options provided:
     A. $98,000  
     B. $59,000  
     C. $66,000  
     D. $69,000  
     E. $161,000  
     F. $90,000  
     G. $75,000  
     H. $54,000  
     I. $82,000  
     J. $61,000  

5. **Identifying the Correct Answer**:
   - Based on our calculation, the markup is $69,000. Now we can match it with the options provided.

So, the answer is (D). 

The answer is (D).

Okay, let's break down this markup problem step-by-step.

**1. Calculate the cost:**

The problem states the cost is 70% of the selling price ($230,000).  Therefore, the cost is:

0.70 * $230,000 = $161,000

**2. Calculate the markup:**

Markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost.  To find the markup, subtract the cost from the selling price:

$230,000 (selling price) - $161,000 (cost) = $69,000

**3. Identify the answer:**

The markup on the stock is $69,000.

The answer is (D)
