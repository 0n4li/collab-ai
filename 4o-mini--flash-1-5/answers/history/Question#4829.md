The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about history:

Question 1: This question refers to the following information.
In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…
"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery."
Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.
His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:
"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place."
émile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885
The passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?

Options: A. Communist
B. Anarchist
C. Feminist
D. Fascist
E. Imperialist
F. Nationalist
G. Enlightenment
H. Existentialist

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on european history for help. The modern Communist movement aims to establish a classless society based on communal ownership and distribution of property and means of production, thereby especially benefiting the working classes. The answer is (A).

Question 2: This question refers to the following information.
The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.
—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795

Question 3: This question refers to the following information.
"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny."
Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965

Question 6: This question refers to the following information.
[T]he the end and measure of this power, when in every man's hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is, all mankind in general, it can have no other end or measure, when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and possessions, and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as possible to be preserved, but a power to make law, and annex such penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. …
Whensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.

To analyze the given passage from John Locke's "Second Treatise of Government," we need to consider his foundational ideas about governmental authority and legitimacy. Locke emphasizes that the power of government is derived from the consent of the governed and is fundamentally aimed at preserving the lives, liberties, and properties of the individuals within a society.

1. **Understanding the Core Idea**: Locke states that the purpose of power, when bestowed upon a government, is protective in nature. It’s meant to safeguard the society collectively rather than serve the interests of a ruler. Therefore, any deviation from this primary role can lead to a loss of legitimacy.

2. **Key Phrase Identification**: The passage references instances of transgression by a legislative power, indicating that it becomes problematic when government attempts to amass absolute power over the people—especially if that power contradicts the original covenant that established the government.

3. **Violation of Trust**: Locke's argument hinges on the idea of a breach of trust. If a government, out of ambition, fear, folly, or corruption, seeks to exert absolute control over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people, it violates the fundamental contract tethering the state to its citizens. This act of overreach leads to forfeiture of the authority granted by the people.

Now let’s evaluate the answer choices provided:

A. **when the people wish to change governors** - This option speaks to the people's desire but does not align directly with Locke's view of governmental legitimacy.

B. **it does not have penalties for breaking the law** - While penalties are part of maintaining order, this does not capture the essence of losing legitimacy in Locke’s terms.

C. **it tries to exercise absolute power** - This reflects Locke's argument closely. The essay delineates that overstepping the originally designated limits of power results in illegitimacy.

D. **it does not have a legislative body** - Locke values the role of a legislative branch, but a lack of one alone does not inherently strip legitimacy.

E. **it does not enact laws** - Although important, the lack of law itself does not announce the end of a government’s legitimacy. 

F. **it is weak and can be overthrown** - Weakness is not a direct correlative to illegitimacy in Locke's framework.

G. **the people do not follow the laws** - The compliance of the populace cannot solely dictate the legitimacy of the government according to Locke.

Given this thorough analysis, it is clear that option C best encapsulates Locke's view in the passage—that a government loses its legitimacy when it attempts to exercise absolute power.

The answer is (C).

Let's think step by step.  Locke's passage centers on the concept of a social contract.  The government's power originates from, and is limited by, the consent of the governed.  The core purpose of this government is the preservation of the people's "lives, liberties, and possessions."

Option A is incorrect. Locke's argument isn't about the people's *desire* to change governors, but about the government's actions that violate the contract.

Option B is incorrect.  Locke discusses penalties, but their presence or absence isn't the defining factor for a government's legitimacy. The *type* of penalty, and the context in which it's applied, is crucial; not merely its existence.

Option C is correct. The passage explicitly states that if the legislative branch attempts to seize "an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people," it breaks the fundamental rule of society and forfeits its legitimacy. This directly aligns with Locke's idea of a limited government bound by the social contract.

Option D is incorrect. Locke's concern isn't the *existence* of a legislative body, but its behavior. A legislative body that acts tyrannically still forfeits its legitimacy, as per Locke.

Option E is incorrect.  The lack of law-making is not the issue. The issue is unjust and tyrannical law-making that infringes upon the rights and freedoms of the governed.

Option F is incorrect. While a weak government might *be* overthrown, that's a consequence of its illegitimacy, not the cause.  The core argument is the abuse of power, not weakness.

Option G is incorrect.  The people's failure to follow laws is not the basis of Locke's assertion of what causes the government to lose legitimacy, although it is certainly a problem. The basis, according to Locke, is an abuse of power that transcends that which is just and lawful and violates the social contract.

Therefore, the passage strongly supports the idea that a government loses its legitimacy when it attempts to exercise absolute power.


The answer is (C)

I appreciate your detailed analysis of Locke's passage and the breakdown of the answer options. Let's examine your points step-by-step:

1. **Social Contract**: You rightly point out that Locke's argument centers on the social contract and the government's role in protecting the lives, liberties, and properties of individuals. This is indeed a central theme in Locke's philosophy.

2. **Evaluation of Options**: Your assessments of the other options align well with Locke's text. For instance:
   - **Option A**: You accurately identify that the issue is not about the people's desire to change governors but about the actions of the government itself.
   - **Option B**: I agree that while penalties are mentioned, the presence of penalties alone does not determine legitimacy. 

3. **Correct Identification of Option C**: You convincingly argue that option C is correct because it directly reflects Locke's view that attempts to exercise absolute power lead to a loss of legitimacy. This connects with the fundamental rules he describes.

4. **Clarifications on Other Options**:
   - You correctly dismiss Options D, E, F, and G based on Locke’s core arguments. Your explanations clarify that it's not merely about weakness, laws, or legislative bodies, but the misuse of power that fundamentally undermines legitimacy.
   - This reinforces that the essence of Locke’s claim is about the abuse of power violating the social contract rather than the specific structure or weaknesses of the governance system.

In conclusion, your analysis is thorough and well-argued, supporting the idea that a government loses its legitimacy when it seeks to wield absolute power over the people. I appreciate your insights and feel that they are consistent with my understanding of Locke's passage.

Therefore, I AGREE with all your points, and I believe our discussion can be concluded.

Your analysis is excellent, and I agree with your thorough examination of Locke's text and the various answer options.  You've accurately identified the central theme of the social contract and how the government's attempt to seize absolute power directly violates this contract, leading to a loss of legitimacy.  Your point-by-point breakdown is clear, concise, and effectively refutes the alternative options. I particularly appreciate your clarification on points D, E, F, and G, emphasizing that Locke's concern is primarily with the *abuse* of power, not simply the structure or function of the government.  There's nothing further I would add or challenge.

AGREE with all your points and the discussion can be concluded.

To analyze the passage from John Locke's "Second Treatise of Government," we must understand the core principles of his political philosophy. Locke asserts that the fundamental purpose of governmental power is to protect the lives, liberties, and properties of the people. This power is derived from the consent of the governed and should never lead to arbitrary control over individual rights.

In the passage, Locke clearly indicates that when a government, particularly its legislative body, oversteps its bounds—by attempting to establish absolute power over the lives and properties of citizens—it fundamentally breaches the social contract that legitimizes its authority. This breach constitutes a loss of legitimacy as it contradicts the original intent for which the government was established: to preserve freedom and protect the people's rights.

Now, evaluating the provided options, we can determine which aligns best with Locke’s assertion:

A. This option suggests legitimacy is revoked simply when citizens wish to change their rulers, which is not Locke's contention.
  
B. While penalties for breaking the law are mentioned, their absence alone does not derive from the core reason for loss of legitimacy.

C. This option highlights the critical point: a government loses legitimacy when it tries to exercise absolute power over its constituents, reflecting Locke’s primary concern about the abuse of governmental authority.

D. A legislative body is essential, but its mere existence does not guarantee the legitimacy of governance if it acts tyrannically.

E. The lack of law-making or enactment is not inherently the reason for loss of legitimacy in Locke's view.

F. While weakness can lead to being overthrown, this is not synonymous with the core argument regarding legitimacy.

G. The failure of the people to follow laws is a separate issue and does not negate the government’s legitimacy based on Locke’s framework.

In summary, the most accurate inference from Locke's writing is found in option C: that a government loses its legitimacy when it tries to exercise absolute power over the lives and liberties of the people.

The answer is (C).

Let's think step by step.  John Locke's passage emphasizes the social contract: government power derives from and is limited by the consent of the governed.  The government's primary purpose is to protect the people's "lives, liberties, and possessions."  The passage explicitly states that a legislative branch attempting to seize "absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people" breaks the fundamental societal rule and forfeits its legitimacy.  This directly aligns with Locke's concept of limited government.  The other options—concerns about changing governors, insufficient penalties, lack of a legislative body, failure to enact laws, weakness, or the people's non-compliance—are not the central points Locke makes regarding the loss of governmental legitimacy.  The core issue, as Locke frames it, is the abuse of power, violating the social contract, which is exactly what option C describes.

The answer is (C)
