The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about economics:

Question 1: For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will

Options: A. Never occur
B. Persist indefinitely
C. Cause a permanent change in the trend
D. Grow exponentially
E. Only affect the next period
F. Eventually die away
G. Cause the process to become non-stationary
H. Immediately disappear
I. Lead to a cyclical pattern
J. Be balanced out by subsequent shocks

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. This is a formal logic problem about stationally process. For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will eventually die away. The answer is (F).

Question 2: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by

Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question 3: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?
(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis
(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used
(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used
(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.

Options: A. (iii) and (iv) only
B. (i) and (iv) only
C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only
D. (i) and (ii) only
E. (i) and (iii) only
F. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).
G. (ii), (iii), and (iv) only
H. (ii) and (iii) only
I. (ii) and (iv) only
J. (i), (iii), and (iv) only

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s reason about each of the options.
(i) is a true statement.
(ii) is a true statement.
(iii) is a true statement.
(iv) is not a true statement. Thus, (i), (ii), and (iii) are true. The answer is (C).

Question 4: Which of the following policies best describes supply-side fiscal policy?

Options: A. Higher taxes on household income
B. Increased government spending
C. Increased taxes on corporate profits
D. Increased import tariffs
E. Decreased interest rates
F. Lower taxes on consumer goods
G. Lower taxes on research and development of new technology
H. Reduced government spending
I. Higher taxes on capital gains
J. An increase in the money supply

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Supply-side fiscal policy stimulates the economy by encouraging more production of goods and services through reduction in taxes and deregulation. The answer is (G).

Question 5: The concentration ratio for a monopoly is

Options: A. 50
B. 5
C. 10
D. 90
E. 15
F. 100
G. 0
H. 25
I. 75

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. The concentration ratio is calculated as the sum of market share of a specific number of largest companies. Monopoly means one company or entity controls the entire market, therefore, the concentration ratio is 100 percent. The answer is (F).

### openai/gpt-4o-mini Initial Response:

To determine the percentage increase in real GDP per capita between 1980 and 1990, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the values**: 
   - Real GDP per capita in 1980 = $20,000
   - Real GDP per capita in 1990 = $21,000

2. **Calculate the difference in GDP per capita**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{GDP per capita (1990)} - \text{GDP per capita (1980)} = 21,000 - 20,000 = 1,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage increase**:
   The formula for the percentage increase is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{GDP per capita (1980)}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{1,000}{20,000} \right) \times 100 = 0.05 \times 100 = 5\%
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: 
   Based on our calculations, the standard of living, as indicated by the increase in real GDP per capita, has increased by 5%.

Now, let's review the answer options:
- A. 2.5 percent
- B. 1.0 percent
- C. 4.0 percent
- D. 10.0 percent
- E. 50 percent
- F. 5.0 percent
- G. 0.5 percent
- H. 7.5 percent
- I. 6.0 percent
- J. 3.3 percent

The calculated percentage increase of 5% corresponds to option F.

Thus, the answer is (F).

Let's think step by step.  We need to calculate the percentage change in real GDP per capita between 1980 and 1990.

1. **Calculate the difference:** The difference in real GDP per capita between 1990 and 1980 is $21,000 - $20,000 = $1,000.

2. **Calculate the percentage change:**  To find the percentage change, we divide the difference by the initial value (1980 GDP per capita) and multiply by 100:

($1,000 / $20,000) * 100 = 5%

Therefore, the standard of living, as measured by real GDP per capita, increased by 5%.

The answer is (F).
