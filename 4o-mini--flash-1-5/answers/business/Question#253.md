To calculate the stock turn rates at cost, selling price, and number of units, we will use the following formulas:

1. **Stock Turn Rate at Cost** = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory Cost
2. **Stock Turn Rate at Selling Price** = Net Sales / Average Inventory Selling Price
3. **Stock Turn Rate in Units** = Number of Units Sold / Average Inventory in Units

Let's break down each calculation step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
From the problem, we know that:
- COGS = $300,000 (given directly)

### Step 2: Average Inventory at Cost
1. **Beginning Inventory at Cost** = $60,000
2. **Ending Inventory at Cost** = $90,000
3. **Average Inventory Cost** = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2
   - Average Inventory Cost = ($60,000 + $90,000) / 2 = $75,000

### Step 3: Calculate Stock Turn Rate at Cost
Using the formula:
- Stock Turn Rate (at Cost) = COGS / Average Inventory Cost
- Stock Turn Rate (at Cost) = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4.0

### Step 4: Average Inventory at Selling Price
1. **Beginning Inventory at Selling Price** = $80,000
2. **Ending Inventory at Selling Price** = $120,000
3. **Average Inventory Selling Price** = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2
   - Average Inventory Selling Price = ($80,000 + $120,000) / 2 = $100,000

### Step 5: Calculate Stock Turn Rate at Selling Price
Using the formula:
- Stock Turn Rate (at Selling Price) = Net Sales / Average Inventory Selling Price
- Stock Turn Rate (at Selling Price) = $380,000 / $100,000 = 3.8

### Step 6: Average Inventory in Units
1. **Beginning Inventory in Units** = 90,000 items
2. **Ending Inventory in Units** = 70,000 items
3. **Average Inventory in Units** = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2
   - Average Inventory in Units = (90,000 + 70,000) / 2 = 80,000 items

### Step 7: Calculate Stock Turn Rate in Units
Using the formula:
- Stock Turn Rate (in Units) = Number of Units Sold / Average Inventory in Units
- Stock Turn Rate (in Units) = 360,000 / 80,000 = 4.5

### Summary of Computations
- Stock Turn Rate (at Cost) = 4.0
- Stock Turn Rate (at Selling Price) = 3.8
- Stock Turn Rate (in Units) = 4.5

Now we can check the available options to see which one matches our results:

1. A. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 2.5, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 5.0, StockturnRate (in units) = 2.0
2. B. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 4.5, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 3.2, StockturnRate (in units) = 5.0
3. C. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 3.0, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 4.8, StockturnRate (in units) = 3.5
4. D. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 5.5, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 2.0, StockturnRate (in units) = 8.0
5. E. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 3.5, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 6.0, StockturnRate (in units) = 3.0
6. F. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 6.0, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 1.8, StockturnRate (in units) = 6.5
7. G. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 5.0, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 2.8, StockturnRate (in units) = 5.5
8. H. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 7.0, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 2.3, StockturnRate (in units) = 7.5
9. I. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 6.5, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 1.5, StockturnRate (in units) = 6.0
10. J. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 4.0, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 3.8, StockturnRate (in units) = 4.5

The only option that matches our calculated Stock Turn Rates is:
**J. StockturnRate (at Cost) = 4.0, StockturnRate (at selling price) = 3.8, StockturnRate (in units) = 4.5**

Therefore, the answer is (J).

Let's break down the stock turnover rate calculation step-by-step.  The stock turnover rate measures how efficiently a business is turning its inventory into sales.  We'll calculate it at cost, selling price, and in units.

**1. Average Inventory at Cost:**

* Beginning inventory cost: $60,000
* Ending inventory cost: $90,000
* Average inventory cost = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = ($60,000 + $90,000) / 2 = $75,000

**2. Average Inventory at Selling Price:**

* Beginning inventory selling price: $80,000
* Ending inventory selling price: $120,000
* Average inventory selling price = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = ($80,000 + $120,000) / 2 = $100,000

**3. Average Inventory in Units:**

* Beginning inventory units: 90,000
* Ending inventory units: 70,000
* Average inventory units = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (90,000 + 70,000) / 2 = 80,000

**4. Stock Turnover Rate Calculations:**

* **Stock Turnover Rate (at Cost):** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory at Cost = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4.0
* **Stock Turnover Rate (at Selling Price):** Net Sales / Average Inventory at Selling Price = $380,000 / $100,000 = 3.8
* **Stock Turnover Rate (in Units):** Units Sold / Average Inventory in Units = 360,000 / 80,000 = 4.5

Therefore, the Stockturn rates are:

* StockturnRate (at Cost) = 4.0
* StockturnRate (at selling price) = 3.8
* StockturnRate (in units) = 4.5

Comparing this result to the provided options, we find no exact match. However, option J is the closest approximation.


The answer is (J)

I appreciate your detailed breakdown of the stock turnover rate calculations and your methodical approach to determining the values at cost, selling price, and in units. You clearly illustrate how to calculate average inventory and how to derive the stock turnover rates. 

Let's go over the points you've made:

1. **Average Inventory Calculations**: You calculated average inventory at cost, selling price, and in units correctly. These calculations are fundamental to understanding how inventory impacts the business's efficiency.

2. **Stock Turnover Rate Calculations**: Your stock turnover rate for cost (4.0), selling price (3.8), and units (4.5) are accurate based on your averaged inventory figures and provided COGS and net sales data.

3. **Comparison to Options**: You noted that while your computed results did not match perfectly with any of the answer options, option J was the closest, which is a reasonable conclusion based on your calculations.

However, I want to point out that your statement saying you found "no exact match" could be further examined. In fact, option J directly aligns with:
- Stock Turn Rate (at Cost) = 4.0
- Stock Turn Rate (at Selling Price) = 3.8
- Stock Turn Rate (in Units) = 4.5

So, while you mentioned it as the closest approximation, it's actually an exact match. This emphasis could clarify our conclusions during discussions about data interpretation and accuracy. 

Overall, I find that your perspective aligns well with my calculations, and no substantial discrepancies exist in our results. Therefore, I AGREE with your points, and we can conclude this discussion. Great job on the analysis!

To determine the stock turnover rates at cost, selling price, and number of units, we perform the following calculations based on the provided information:

### Step 1: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
COGS is given as $300,000.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Inventory at Cost
- **Beginning Inventory at Cost**: $60,000
- **Ending Inventory at Cost**: $90,000
- **Average Inventory Cost**: 
  \[
  \text{Average Inventory Cost} = \frac{(60,000 + 90,000)}{2} = 75,000
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Stock Turn Rate at Cost
Using the formula:
\[
\text{Stock Turn Rate (at Cost)} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory Cost}} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4.0
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Average Inventory at Selling Price
- **Beginning Inventory at Selling Price**: $80,000
- **Ending Inventory at Selling Price**: $120,000
- **Average Inventory Selling Price**:

Let's think step by step.

To calculate the stock turn rates, we need to determine the average inventory at cost, selling price, and in units.

**1. Average Inventory at Cost:**

* Beginning inventory cost: $60,000
* Ending inventory cost: $90,000
* Average inventory cost = ($60,000 + $90,000) / 2 = $75,000

**2. Average Inventory at Selling Price:**

* Beginning inventory selling price: $80,000
* Ending inventory selling price: $120,000
* Average inventory selling price = ($80,000 + $120,000) / 2 = $100,000

**3. Average Inventory in Units:**

* Beginning inventory units: 90,000
* Ending inventory units: 70,000
* Average inventory units = (90,000 + 70,000) / 2 = 80,000

**4. Stock Turnover Rate Calculations:**

* **Stock Turnover Rate (at Cost):** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory at Cost = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4.0
* **Stock Turnover Rate (at Selling Price):** Net Sales / Average Inventory at Selling Price = $380,000 / $100,000 = 3.8
* **Stock Turnover Rate (in Units):** Units Sold / Average Inventory in Units = 360,000 / 80,000 = 4.5

Therefore, the Stockturn rates are:

* StockturnRate (at Cost) = 4.0
* StockturnRate (at selling price) = 3.8
* StockturnRate (in units) = 4.5

The answer is (J)
