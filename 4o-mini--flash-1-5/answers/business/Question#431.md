To determine Mr. Darnell's loss per share and his total loss, we need to follow a clear step-by-step analysis.

1. **Calculate the Purchase Price**:
   - Mr. Darnell purchased 20 shares at $182.50 per share. 
   - Total cost of purchase = Number of shares × Price per share
   - Total cost = 20 shares × $182.50/share = $3,650.00

2. **Calculate the Selling Price**:
   - He sold the shares at $168.75 per share. 
   - Total selling price = Number of shares × Selling price per share
   - Total selling price = 20 shares × $168.75/share = $3,375.00

3. **Calculate the Total Loss**:
   - Total Loss = Total Cost - Total Selling Price
   - Total Loss = $3,650.00 - $3,375.00 = $275.00

4. **Calculate Loss Per Share**:
   - Loss Per Share = Total Loss / Number of Shares
   - Loss Per Share = $275.00 / 20 shares = $13.75

Now we can summarize our findings:
- Loss per share is $13.75.
- Total loss is $275.00.

Looking at the answer options:
A. $15.75 per share, $315.00 total loss
B. $12.75 per share, $255.00 total loss
C. $13.75 per share, $275.00 total loss
D. $14.75 per share, $295.00 total loss

The correct answer matches option C.

The answer is (C).

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step.  Mr. Darnell's situation involves calculating a loss on a stock investment.

**Step 1: Calculate the loss per share.**

To find the loss per share, we subtract the selling price from the purchase price:

Purchase price per share: $182.50
Selling price per share: $168.75

Loss per share = $182.50 - $168.75 = $13.75

**Step 2: Calculate the total loss.**

Mr. Darnell owned 20 shares.  To find the total loss, we multiply the loss per share by the number of shares:

Loss per share: $13.75
Number of shares: 20

Total loss = $13.75 * 20 = $275.00

**Step 3: Compare to the options.**

Our calculations show a loss of $13.75 per share and a total loss of $275.00.  Looking at the options provided, this matches option C.

The answer is (C)

2. **Total Loss Calculation**: Your method of determining the total loss by multiplying the loss per share by the total number of shares is also correct. This leads to a total loss of $275.00, which aligns perfectly with the calculations and reasoning presented.

3. **Comparison with Options**: You effectively cross-referenced your calculated results with the answer options provided, correctly identifying option C as matching your findings.

Overall, I find no mistakes in your reasoning or calculations, which leads me to conclude that your perspective on Mr. Darnell’s stock transaction is accurate.

To determine Mr. Darnell's loss per share and his total loss, we need to perform the following calculations:

1. **Calculate the Purchase Price**:
   - Mr. Darnell purchased 20 shares at $182.50 per share. 
   - Total cost of purchase = Number of shares × Price per share = 20 shares × $182.50/share = $3,650.00.

2. **Calculate the Selling Price**:
   - He sold the shares at $168.75 per share. 
   - Total selling price = Number of shares × Selling price per share = 20 shares × $168.75/share = $3,375.00.

3. **Calculate the Total Loss**:
   - Total Loss = Total Cost - Total Selling Price = $3,650.00 - $3,375.00 = $275.00.

4. **Calculate Loss Per Share**:
   - Loss Per Share = Total Loss / Number of Shares = $275.00 / 20 shares = $13.75.

After performing these calculations, we can summarize the findings:
- Loss per share is $13.75.
- Total loss is $275.00.

Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the loss per share:**  The selling price ($168.75) is subtracted from the purchase price ($182.50): $182.50 - $168.75 = $13.75 loss per share.

2. **Calculate the total loss:** The loss per share ($13.75) is multiplied by the number of shares (20): $13.75 * 20 = $275.00 total loss.

Therefore, Mr. Darnell had a loss of $13.75 per share and a total loss of $275.00.

The answer is (C)
