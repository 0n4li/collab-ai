To calculate the percent of increase in brush sales from one week to the next, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sales numbers**:
   - Sales in the first week = 927 brushes
   - Sales in the second week = 1,059 brushes

2. **Calculate the increase in sales**:
   - Increase = Sales in the second week - Sales in the first week
   - Increase = 1,059 - 927 = 132 brushes

3. **Calculate the percent of increase**:
   - Percent of increase = (Increase / Sales in the first week) × 100
   - Percent of increase = (132 / 927) × 100

4. **Perform the calculation**:
   - Percent of increase = 0.1423 × 100 ≈ 14.23%

Now, let's look at the options provided:
- A. 10%
- B. 22.7%
- C. 16.8%
- D. 20.4%
- E. 17.3%
- F. 18.6%
- G. 13.5%
- H. 12.5%
- I. 14.239%
- J. 15.2%

The closest option to our calculated percent of increase (approximately 14.23%) is **I. 14.239%**.

Therefore, I conclude that:

The answer is (I).

Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.  The question asks for the percent increase in brush sales from week one to week two.

**Step 1: Find the difference in sales.**

The salesman sold 1059 brushes in the second week and 927 brushes in the first week.  The difference is:

1059 - 927 = 132 brushes

**Step 2: Calculate the percent increase.**

The percent increase is calculated by dividing the difference in sales by the original number of sales (from the first week) and then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.

Percent Increase = [(Difference in Sales) / (Original Sales)] * 100

Percent Increase = (132 / 927) * 100

Percent Increase ≈ 14.239%

**Step 3: Compare to the options.**

Our calculated percent increase is approximately 14.239%. Looking at the options provided, option (I) matches this value.

Therefore:

The answer is (I)

I appreciate your thorough breakdown of the solution for calculating the percent increase in brush sales. You've laid out the steps clearly and executed the calculations accurately. I agree that the difference in sales is 132 brushes, and your method for calculating the percent increase is correct.

Your clarification on how to calculate the percent increase using the formula \((\text{Difference in Sales} / \text{Original Sales}) \times 100\) is very helpful for understanding the process. Furthermore, I concur that our calculated result of approximately 14.239% aligns well with option (I).

Overall, you've covered all the necessary points accurately, and your reasoning is consistent with the problem-solving process for calculating percentage increases. 

Thus, I AGREE with all your points and the discussion can be concluded.

To find the percent of increase in the number of brushes sold from one week to the next, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sales numbers**:
   - Sales in the first week = 927 brushes
   - Sales in the second week = 1,059 brushes

2. **Calculate the increase in sales**:
   - Increase = Sales in the second week - Sales in the first week
   - Increase = 1,059 - 927 = 132 brushes

3. **Calculate the percent of increase**:
   - Percent of increase = (Increase / Sales in the first week) × 100
   - Percent of increase = (132 / 927) × 100

4. **Perform the calculation**:
   - Percent of increase ≈ 0.1423 × 100 ≈ 14.239%

Now, comparing to the options provided:
- A. 10%
- B. 22.7%
- C. 16.8%
- D. 20.4%
- E. 17.3%
- F. 18.6%
- G. 13.5%
- H. 12.5%
- I. 14.239%
- J. 15.2%

The closest option to our calculated percent of increase (approximately 14.239%) is **I. 14.239%**.

Thus, the answer is (I).
