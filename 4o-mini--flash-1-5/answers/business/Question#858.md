To tackle the question about the markdowns for the shirt in FabersClothing Store, we will go through each step methodically.

1. **Identify the original price** and sale price:
   - The original price of the shirt: **$6.75**
   - The reduced sale price: **$4.50**

2. **Calculate the gross markdown**:
   Gross markdown represents the total reduction from the original price.
   \[
   \text{Gross Markdown} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Sale Price} = 6.75 - 4.50 = 2.25
   \]
   So, the gross markdown is **$2.25**.

3. **Identify the current price after the sale**:
   - The current price after the sale is: **$5.50**

4. **Calculate the net markdown**:
   Net markdown is the difference between the sale price and the current price.
   \[
   \text{Net Markdown} = \text{Sale Price} - \text{Current Price} = 4.50 - 5.50
   \]
   This results in a negative value, indicating that the price has actually increased. Therefore, since 5.50 is higher than 4.50, the net markdown in this context can be considered as:
   \[
   \text{Net Markdown} = 5.50 - 4.50 = 1.00 \quad (\text{in dollar terms as we're calculating from the sale price to the new price})
   \]
   Hence, the net markdown is **$1.00**.

5. **Calculate net markdown as a percent of the current price**:
   To find the net markdown percentage, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Net Markdown Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Net Markdown}}{\text{Current Price}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net Markdown Percentage} = \left(\frac{1.00}{5.50}\right) \times 100 \approx 18.18\%
   \]
   This rounds to approximately **18.2%**.

Now, let’s summarize our calculations:
- Gross Markdown: **$2.25**
- Net Markdown: **$1.00**
- Net Markdown Percentage: **18.2%**

Comparing these results to the provided options:
- The closest match is **Option A: Gross Markdown: $2.25, Net Markdown: $1.00, Net Markdown Percentage: 18.2%**.

Therefore, upon careful evaluation of all factors involved:

The answer is (A).

Okay, let's break down this pricing problem step-by-step.

**1. Calculate the Gross Markdown:**

* The original price was $6.75.
* The sale price was $4.50.
* The gross markdown is the difference between the original price and the sale price: $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25

**2. Calculate the Net Markdown:**

* The sale price was $4.50.
* The price after the sale was $5.50.  This means the price increased by $1.00 from the sale price.
* The net markdown is the difference between the original price and the final price: $6.75 - $5.50 = $1.25

**3. Calculate the Net Markdown Percentage:**

* The net markdown is $1.25.
* The current (final) price is $5.50.
* The net markdown percentage is calculated as (Net Markdown / Current Price) * 100%: ($1.25 / $5.50) * 100% = 22.7% (approximately)

**Therefore, the correct answer is:**

The Gross Markdown is $2.25, the Net Markdown is $1.25, and the Net Markdown Percentage is approximately 22.7%.

The answer is (D)

Thank you for breaking down your analysis; it's clear you've put thought into it. Let's discuss your points step by step.

1. **Gross Markdown Calculation**: We agree on this part. The gross markdown indeed is calculated as:
   \[
   6.75 - 4.50 = 2.25
   \]
   This confirms that the gross markdown is **$2.25**, and I see no disagreement here.

2. **Net Markdown Calculation**: This is where our views diverge. You calculated the net markdown as:
   \[
   6.75 - 5.50 = 1.25
   \]
   However, the net markdown typically refers to the difference from the sale price to the current price, which in this case means:
   \[
   4.50 - 5.50 = -1.00
   \]
   Since the price has increased after the sale, it can be viewed as a lack of markdown from the sale price perspective. Thus, though your calculation gives $1.25 when comparing the original and the current price, it doesn’t accurately represent the markdown situation post-sale.

3. **Net Markdown Percentage**: Given your calculation of the net markdown, your percentage would also be based on a calculation of:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1.25}{5.50}\right) \times 100 \approx 22.7\%
   \]
   But since there’s a misunderstanding of the net markdown initially, the percentage should reflect from the sale price rather than the original price. Using my perspective, we would apply:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1.00}{5.50}\right) \times 100 \approx 18.18\%
   \]
   which rounds to **18.2%**.

In summary, I believe your overall interpretation of the gross markdown is accurate, but there seems to be confusion regarding the net markdown calculation, leading to the final net markdown percentage being different. 

Thus, based on our discussion:
- I **DISAGREE** with your net markdown and net markdown percentage calculations but agree with the gross markdown analysis. I want to continue discussing these specific points to reach a common understanding.

You raise some valid points, and I appreciate the detailed breakdown of your reasoning.  I see where my calculation of the net markdown went astray.  My mistake was focusing on the difference between the original price and the final price instead of the difference between the sale price and the final price.  The question asks for the *net* markdown, meaning the markdown *after* the initial sale.  The price increased after the sale. Therefore, my calculation of the net markdown is incorrect.

Your calculation of the net markdown as $1.00 ($5.50 - $4.50) accurately reflects the price increase after the initial sale, from the sale price perspective. This is a more appropriate way to represent the information.  Consequently, your net markdown percentage calculation of approximately 18.2% is also the correct one derived from that.

Therefore I agree that option A ($2.25 gross markdown, $1.00 net markdown, 18.2% net markdown percentage) is the correct answer, based on the clarified understanding of what constitutes "net markdown" in this particular context.


I AGREE with your points and the discussion can be concluded.

Thank you for your thoughtful and reflective response. You accurately identified the misunderstanding in your earlier calculation regarding the net markdown, and I appreciate your recognition of the right approach to calculate it.

To recap our discussion:

1. **Gross Markdown**: We both correctly calculated the gross markdown at $2.25.
  
2. **Net Markdown**: You've acknowledged the error in your method of calculating the net markdown by incorrectly using the original price. I’m glad you see the appropriate perspective when determining it from the sale price leading to a net markdown of $1.00, given the price increase.

3. **Net Markdown Percentage**: Your acceptance of the correct calculation as approximately 18.2% reaffirms the approach that focuses on the correct context of markdown calculations.

Your agreement with my revised interpretation and acknowledgment of the correct figures demonstrates a strong collaborative effort in understanding the problem. Since you agree with my points and have provided constructive feedback, I feel we reached a resolution.

Therefore, I **AGREE** with all your points and the discussion can be concluded. Thank you for a productive dialogue!

Let's analyze the scenario provided regarding the shirt markdowns in FabersClothing Store. 

1. **Original Price and Sale Price**:
   - The original price of the shirt is **$6.75**.
   - During the storewide sale, the price was reduced to **$4.50**.

2. **Calculate Gross Markdown**:
   Gross markdown is the difference between the original price and the sale price.
   \[
   \text{Gross Markdown} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Sale Price} = 6.75 - 4.50 = 2.25
   \]
   This means the gross markdown is **$2.25**.

3. **Current Price After Sale**:
   The price after the sale was changed to **$5.50**.

4. **Calculate Net Markdown**:
   Net markdown is determined as the difference between the sale price and the current price.
   \[
   \text{Net Markdown} = \text{Current Price} - \text{Sale Price} = 5.50 - 4.50 = 1.00
   \]
   Thus, the net markdown is **$1.00**.

5. **Calculate Net Markdown Percentage**:
   The net markdown percentage is calculated based on the current price:
   \[
   \text{Net Markdown Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Net Markdown}}{\text{Current Price}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1.00}{5.50}\right) \times 100 \approx 18.18\%
   \]
   Approximately, this is **18.2%**.

Summarizing the calculations:
- Gross Markdown: **$2.25**
- Net Markdown: **$1.00**
- Net Markdown Percentage: **18.2%**

With these calculations completed and confirmed, the correct answer from the options provided is:

The answer is (A).

Let's think step by step.

1. **Gross Markdown:** The original price was $6.75, and the sale price was $4.50.  The gross markdown is the difference: $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25

2. **Net Markdown:** The sale price was $4.50, and the price after the sale was $5.50. The net markdown (reflecting the change from the sale price) is $5.50 - $4.50 = $1.00.  Note that this is a *markup* from the sale price, but the question asks for the net markdown, and this represents the change from the sale price perspective.

3. **Net Markdown Percentage:** The net markdown is $1.00, and the final price is $5.50. The net markdown percentage is ($1.00 / $5.50) * 100% ≈ 18.2%

Therefore, the gross markdown is $2.25, the net markdown is $1.00, and the net markdown percentage is approximately 18.2%.

The answer is (A)
