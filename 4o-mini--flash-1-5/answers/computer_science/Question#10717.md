The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about computer science:

Question 1: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:
ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.
Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?

Options: A. 10
B. 6
C. 9
D. 5
E. 12
F. 4
G. 7
H. 8

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.
Next, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.
Next, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.
We can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:
compute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3
compute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4
compute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5
compute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6
STALL
compute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7
So there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).

Question 2: A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.
G := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F
The target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is

Options: A. 7
B. 5
C. 12
D. 4
E. 11
F. 6
G. 8
H. 10
I. 9
J. 3

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:
1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)
2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)
3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)
4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)
5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)
6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)
7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)
8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)
9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)
This sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (I).

Question 3: SHA-1 has a message digest of

Options: A. 628 bits
B. 780 bits
C. 160 bits
D. 256 bits
E. 2048 bits
F. 820 bits
G. 128 bits
H. 512 bits
I. 1024 bits
J. 64 bits

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. Since SHA-1 is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, its message digest is 160 bits. The answer is (C).

Question 4: _____________ can modify data on your system – so that your system doesn’t run correctly or you can no longer access specific data, or it may even ask for ransom in order to give your access.

Options: A. Email Trojans
B. Backdoor Trojans
C. Rootkit Trojans
D. Banking Trojans
E. Trojan-Downloader
F. Spyware Trojans
G. Network Trojans
H. Worm Trojans
I. Ransom Trojan
J. IM – Trojans

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. The system is asking for trojans, which are for ransom, which means ransom trojan. The answer is (I).

Question 5: In the program below, the initial value of X is 5 and the initial value of Y is 10.
IF (X < 0){
 DISPLAY ("Foxtrot")
} ELSE {
 IF (X > Y){
  DISPLAY ("Hotel")
 } ELSE {
  IF (Y > 0){
   DISPLAY ("November")
  } ELSE {
   DISPLAY ("Yankee")
  }
 }
}
What is displayed as a result of running the program?

Options: A. November
B. Foxtrot
C. Zulu
D. Alpha
E. Charlie
F. Bravo
G. Yankee
H. Echo
I. Hotel
J. Delta

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. Because X has the value 5, the first conditional IF (X < 0) is false, so we move to the first ELSE clause. Because X is 5 and Y is 10, the second conditional IF (X > Y) is false, so we move to the following ELSE clause. Since Y is 10, the conditional IF (Y > 0) is true, so the command DISPLAY ("November") is executed. The answer is (A).

To determine the value of `x >> 1` in Python 3 where `x` is 8, we need to understand how the bitwise right shift operator (`>>`) works. 

1. **Understanding Right Shift Operator**: The `>>` operator takes the binary representation of a number and shifts its bits to the right by a specified number of positions. Each shift to the right divides the number by 2.

2. **Binary Representation of 8**: The number 8 is represented in binary as `1000`.
   - In binary: 
     ```
     8 in binary = 1000
     ```

3. **Applying the Right Shift**: When we perform `x >> 1`, we are shifting the bits of `1000` one position to the right.
   - After right shifting `1000` by one position, we get:
     ```
     0100
     ```

4. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: Now, we convert `0100` back to decimal.
   - `0100` in decimal is 4.

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, `8 >> 1` results in 4.

Now let's look at the provided options:

A. 5  
B. 3  
C. 0  
D. 8  
E. 4  
F. 7  
G. 1  
H. 2  
I. 6  
J. 16  

Since we have concluded that `x >> 1` where `x = 8` is equal to 4, the correct answer is:

The answer is (E).

Let's think step by step. The expression `x >> 1` in Python represents a right bitwise shift operation.  This operation shifts the bits of the integer `x` one position to the right.  The rightmost bit is discarded, and a 0 is inserted on the left.

Let's examine the binary representation of x = 8:

8 in decimal is 1000 in binary.

When we perform a right bitwise shift by 1 (`>> 1`), we get:

1000 >> 1 = 0100

0100 in binary is 4 in decimal.

Therefore, `x >> 1` when x = 8 results in 4.


The answer is (E)

To solve the question "Let x = 8. What is x >> 1 in Python 3?", we need to analyze the operation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Right Shift Operator**: The `>>` operator performs a right bitwise shift on the binary representation of a number. This means that each shift to the right effectively divides the number by 2.

2. **Binary Representation of 8**: The number 8 in binary is represented as `1000`.

3. **Applying the Right Shift**: When we apply `x >> 1` to `1000`, we shift the bits one position to the right. This gives us:
   - Original: `1000`
   - After shifting: `0100`

4. **Converting the Result Back to Decimal**: The binary number `0100` corresponds to 4 in decimal.

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the expression `x >> 1` when `x` is 8 evaluates to 4.

Considering all the analysis and calculations, the correct answer from the provided options is:

The answer is (E).

Let's think step by step. The expression `x >> 1` in Python performs a right bitwise shift.  This means the bits of the integer `x` are shifted one position to the right. The rightmost bit is discarded, and a 0 is inserted on the left.

If x = 8, its binary representation is 1000.

Shifting right by 1 (`>> 1`) gives: 1000 >> 1 = 0100

0100 in binary is 4 in decimal.

Therefore, `x >> 1` when x = 8 equals 4.

The answer is (E).
