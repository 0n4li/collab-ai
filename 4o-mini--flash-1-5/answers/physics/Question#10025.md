The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about physics:

Question 1: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?

Options: A. 1000 times more
B. 50 times more
C. 5000 times more
D. 500 times more
E. 10000 times more
F. 20000 times more
G. 2000 times more
H. 100 times more
I. 10 times more

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (E).

Question 2: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?

Options: A. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.
B. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.
C. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.
D. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
E. The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud.
F. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
G. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).

Question 3: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is

Options: A. 10
B. 40
C. 6
D. 25
E. 15
F. 50
G. 30
H. 4
I. 5
J. 20

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (H).

Question 4: Colors in a soap bubble result from light

Options: A. dispersion
B. deflection
C. refraction
D. reflection
E. interference
F. converted to a different frequency
G. polarization
H. absorption
I. diffraction
J. transmission

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors being visible. The answer is (E).

Question 5: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?

Options: A. 240 W
B. 120 W
C. 10 W
D. 480 W
E. 360 W
F. 200 W
G. 30 W
H. 150 W
I. 60 W
J. 300 W

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (A).

To solve this question, we need to analyze what happens when boron-10 (^10B) is bombarded with neutrons and emits alpha particles. 

1. **Understanding the Process**: 
   - When ^10B absorbs a neutron, it becomes ^11B (boron-11). The reaction can be written as:
     \[ \text{^10_5B} + \text{n} \rightarrow \text{^11_5B} \]
   
2. **Emission of Alpha Particle**: 
   - An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, or in nuclear notation, it is represented as ^4_2He. When an alpha particle is emitted from ^11B, the nuclear equation changes as follows:
     \[ \text{^11_5B} \rightarrow \text{^4_2He} + X \]
   - Here, \(X\) is the residual nucleus we need to determine.

3. **Balancing the Nucleons**:
   - To find the residual nucleus \(X\), we need to ensure that the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) is conserved in this reaction. 
   - ^11B has 5 protons and 6 neutrons (11 total nucleons).
   - The emitted alpha particle (^4_2He) has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (4 total nucleons).
   - To find nucleons in \(X\):
     - Total before emission: \(11\)
     - Total after emission: \(4\) (from the alpha particle) + \(N(X)\)
     - Setting it together: 
       \[ 11 = 4 + N(X) \]
       \[ N(X) = 11 - 4 = 7 \]
       - Therefore, the residual nucleus must contain \(11 - 4 = 7\) nucleons.

4. **Finding the Residual Nucleus**:
   - Because the number of protons in ^11B is 5, and after emitting an alpha particle, the number of protons in the residual nucleus will be:
     \[ 5 - 2 = 3 \] 
   - So, we have a residual nucleus with 3 protons and a total of 7 nucleons, which means there are \(7 - 3 = 4\) neutrons.

5. **Identifying the Nucleus**:
   - The only isotope that has 3 protons (which is lithium, Li) and 4 neutrons would be:
     - ^7_3Li

Now looking at the options:

- A. ^8_4Be
- B. ^13_6C
- C. ^7_4Be
- D. ^6_3Li
- E. ^5_2He
- F. ^11_5B
- G. ^10_5B
- H. ^7_3Li
- I. ^9_4Be
- J. ^12_6C

**Conclusion**:
The correct answer is ^7_3Li, matching my calculation.

The answer is (H).

Let's think step by step.  The question describes a nuclear reaction where Boron-10 (⁵₁₀B) is bombarded with neutrons (⁰₁n). Alpha particles (⁴₂He) are emitted. We need to find the resulting nucleus.

The general form of a nuclear reaction is:

A + B → C + D

where A and B are the reactants, and C and D are the products.  In our case:

⁵₁₀B + ⁰₁n →  C + ⁴₂He

To find the unknown nucleus C, we need to conserve the total number of protons and neutrons.

* **Mass number (nucleons):** The sum of the mass numbers on the left side must equal the sum of the mass numbers on the right side.  Therefore: 10 + 1 = A + 4, where A is the mass number of the residual nucleus. Solving for A gives A = 7.

* **Atomic number (protons):** The sum of the atomic numbers on the left side must equal the sum of the atomic numbers on the right side. Therefore: 5 + 0 = Z + 2, where Z is the atomic number of the residual nucleus. Solving for Z gives Z = 3.

So the residual nucleus has a mass number of 7 and an atomic number of 3.  This corresponds to Lithium-7 (⁷₃Li).

Therefore:

⁵₁₀B + ⁰₁n → ⁷₃Li + ⁴₂He

The answer is (H).

To determine the residual nucleus when Boron-10 (^10B) is bombarded with neutrons and emits alpha particles, we can analyze the nuclear reaction step by step.

1. **Starting Reaction**: The incident neutron adds to the Boron-10 nucleus.
   \[
   \text{^10_5B} + \text{n} \rightarrow \text{^11_5B}
   \]

2. **Emission of the Alpha Particle**: When an alpha particle is emitted from the newly formed Boron-11 nucleus, it can be represented as:
   \[
   \text{^11_5B} \rightarrow \text{^4_2He} + X
   \]
   Here, \(X\) is the residual nucleus we need to find.

3. **Conservation of Nucleons**:
   - On the left-hand side, we have 11 nucleons (5 protons + 6 neutrons).
   - The emitted alpha particle contributes 4 nucleons (2 protons + 2 neutrons).
   - Therefore, setting up a conservation equation gives us:
   \[
   11 = 4 + N(X)
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   N(X) = 11 - 4 = 7
   \]

4. **Determining Protons**:
   - The Boron-11 nucleus has 5 protons. After emitting the alpha particle (which has 2 protons), the number of protons in the residual nucleus will be:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3
   \]
   
5. **Identifying the Residual Nucleus**:
   - We have determined that the residual nucleus has 3 protons (which corresponds to lithium) and a total of 7 nucleons. This configuration corresponds to Lithium-7:
   \[
   \text{^7_3Li}
   \]

Thus, the final residual nucleus after the bombardment of Boron-10 with neutrons and the emission of alpha particles is Lithium-7.

The answer is (H).

Let's think step by step. The question describes a nuclear reaction where Boron-10 (^10_5B) is bombarded with a neutron (^1_0n), resulting in the emission of an alpha particle (^4_2He).  To find the residual nucleus, we need to conserve both mass number (nucleons) and atomic number (protons).

**Conserving Mass Number:**

* Initial mass number: 10 (from ^10_5B) + 1 (from ^1_0n) = 11
* Final mass number: A (from the residual nucleus) + 4 (from ^4_2He)
* Therefore: 11 = A + 4  =>  A = 7

**Conserving Atomic Number:**

* Initial atomic number: 5 (from ^10_5B) + 0 (from ^1_0n) = 5
* Final atomic number: Z (from the residual nucleus) + 2 (from ^4_2He)
* Therefore: 5 = Z + 2 => Z = 3

A nucleus with a mass number of 7 and an atomic number of 3 is Lithium-7 (^7_3Li).  The nuclear reaction is:

^10_5B + ^1_0n → ^7_3Li + ^4_2He

The answer is (H).
