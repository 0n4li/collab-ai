To determine the amount Rune Co. should report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet, let's analyze the situation step-by-step, taking into consideration the details provided about the checks and balances.

1. **Initial Balance**: The checkbook balance on December 31 is reported as $10,000. This is our starting point.

2. **Postdated Check**: There is a $4,000 check payable to Rune that is postdated January 3. Since this check is postdated, it cannot be considered cash available to Rune on December 31. Therefore, we will not include this amount in our cash balance for the December 31 balance sheet.

3. **Returned NSF Check**: There is also a $1,000 check that was deposited on December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance. However, this check was returned on December 30 with an “NSF” (non-sufficient funds) stamp. This means that it did not actually contribute to available cash as of December 31. Thus, we must subtract this $1,000 from the initial balance.

4. **Adjustment of Cash Balance**: 
   - Starting balance: $10,000
   - Subtract the NSF check: $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000

Now, let's summarize the figures:
- **Final Cash Reported**: With the inclusion of other checks or transactions (such as the $4,000 postdated check), our total cash available for reporting on December 31 remains unaffected since it's not recognized until after its date.

As such, the correct final amount Rune should report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet is $9,000.

Thus, I conclude:
The answer is (F) $9,000.

Let's analyze Rune Co.'s cash position on December 31st step-by-step:

1. **Checkbook Balance:** The starting point is the checkbook balance of $10,000.  This represents the cash Rune Co. believed it had based on its own records.

2. **Postdated Check:**  A $4,000 check payable to Rune is postdated January 3rd.  This means it wasn't valid or collectible until after December 31st. Therefore, it shouldn't be included in the December 31st cash balance.

3. **NSF Check:** A $1,000 check deposited on December 15th and included in the $10,000 checkbook balance was returned NSF (Non-Sufficient Funds) before the end of the month. This means the money was never actually received.  Therefore, this $1,000 should be subtracted from the checkbook balance.

4. **Calculation:** To determine the correct cash balance, we start with the checkbook balance and adjust for the NSF check:

   $10,000 (Checkbook Balance) - $1,000 (NSF Check) = $9,000

Therefore, the amount Rune Co. should report as cash in its December 31st balance sheet is $9,000. The postdated check is not considered because it hasn't been collected yet.

The answer is (F).

[//]: # (2024-11-17 19:40:31)
I appreciate your detailed analysis of Rune Co.'s cash position. You've outlined each step clearly, and I can see the rationale behind it.

1. **Checkbook Balance**: Agreed. The starting point of $10,000 is indeed the balance Rune Co. believed it had.

2. **Postdated Check**: I concur with your conclusion that the $4,000 check is postdated and cannot be included in the cash balance for December 31. This is an important detail in cash management and accounting practices.

3. **NSF Check**: Your explanation of the $1,000 NSF check is correct. Since the check was returned for insufficient funds, it did not translate into actual cash, and subtracting it from the checkbook balance is the right approach.

4. **Calculation**: The calculation you provided is accurate and leads to the same conclusion I reached: $10,000 (initial balance) - $1,000 (NSF) = $9,000. 

Overall, I believe you have covered all the relevant points clearly and accurately. Thus, I agree with your assessment that Rune Co. should report $9,000 as cash on its December 31 balance sheet. 

Given that we are in agreement on all points, we can conclude this discussion.

To determine the amount Rune Co. should report as cash on its December 31 balance sheet, let’s analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Initial Balance**: The checkbook balance on December 31 is reported as $10,000. This represents the cash Rune Co. believed it had.

2. **Postdated Check**: There is a $4,000 check payable to Rune that is postdated January 3 and cannot be considered as cash available on December 31. Hence, this amount will not be included in our cash balance.

3. **Returned NSF Check**: A $1,000 check that was deposited on December 15 was included in the checkbook balance but was returned NSF (non-sufficient funds) before the end of December. Since this check did not result in actual cash receipt, it must be subtracted from the checkbook balance.

4. **Calculation of Available Cash**:
   - Starting balance: $10,000
   - Subtract the NSF check: $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000

In conclusion, given the consideration of the checks and adjustments, the amount Rune Co. should report as cash on its December 31 balance sheet is $9,000.

The answer is (F) $9,000.

[//]: # (2024-11-17 19:40:59)
Let's think step by step.  Rune Co.'s checkbook balance was $10,000.  The postdated check for $4,000 is not included because it's not yet collectible. The $1,000 NSF check should be subtracted because it represents funds that were never actually received.  Therefore, the correct cash balance to report on the December 31 balance sheet is $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000.

The answer is (F).
