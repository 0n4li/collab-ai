To determine the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupon interest, and a yield of 6%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand Bond Pricing**: The price of a bond is the present value of its future cash flows, which consist of the annual coupon payments and the repayment of face value at maturity.

2. **Calculate Annual Coupon Payment**: 
   - Since the bond has a face value of $100 and a coupon rate of 5%, the annual coupon payment is:
     \[
     \text{Coupon Payment} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Coupon Rate} = 100 \times 0.05 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine Cash Flows**: 
   - This bond will make three annual coupon payments of $5 each for three years. Additionally, it will pay the face value ($100) at the end of the third year.

4. **Calculate Present Value of Cash Flows**: 
   - The formula for present value (PV) is:
     \[
     PV = \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t}
     \]
   - where \(C\) is the cash flow in each year, \(r\) is the yield (or discount rate), and \(t\) is the year.

5. **Discount Each Cash Flow**:
   - For the first year:
     \[
     PV_1 = \frac{5}{(1 + 0.06)^1} = \frac{5}{1.06} \approx 4.72
     \]
   - For the second year:
     \[
     PV_2 = \frac{5}{(1 + 0.06)^2} = \frac{5}{1.1236} \approx 4.45
     \]
   - For the third year (including the repayment of face value):
     \[
     PV_3 = \frac{5 + 100}{(1 + 0.06)^3} = \frac{105}{1.191016} \approx 88.14
     \]

6. **Total Present Value**: 
   - Now, we sum the present values of all cash flows:
     \[
     \text{Total PV} = PV_1 + PV_2 + PV_3 \approx 4.72 + 4.45 + 88.14 \approx 97.31
     \]

7. **Price of the Bond**: 
   - Thus, the estimated price of the bond is approximately $97.31. Since this value is close to one of the provided options, we can select the nearest value available.

After evaluating the options, the closest match is:
The answer is (D).

Okay, let's tackle this bond pricing problem.  We need to calculate the present value of the bond's future cash flows, which consist of coupon payments and the face value repayment.  The formula for the present value of a bond is:

PV = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r + FV / (1 + r)^n

Where:

* PV = Present Value (the price of the bond)
* C = Coupon payment per period (5% of $100 = $5)
* r = Yield to maturity per period (6%/1 = 6% = 0.06) - We're assuming an annual yield.
* n = Number of periods (3 years)
* FV = Face value ($100)

Let's plug in the numbers:

PV = $5 * [1 - (1 + 0.06)^-3] / 0.06 + $100 / (1 + 0.06)^3

1. Calculate (1 + 0.06)^-3:  This is approximately 0.8396

2. Calculate [1 - (1 + 0.06)^-3]:  This is 1 - 0.8396 = 0.1604

3. Calculate $5 * [1 - (1 + 0.06)^-3] / 0.06: This is $5 * 0.1604 / 0.06 = $13.37

4. Calculate $100 / (1 + 0.06)^3: This is $100 / 1.1910 = $83.96

5. Add the results from steps 3 and 4: $13.37 + $83.96 = $97.33

Therefore, the price of the bond is approximately $97.33.

The answer is (D)

I appreciate your detailed breakdown of the bond pricing problem! Your perspective is quite clear and methodical, and I agree with most of your calculations leading up to the final bond price. However, there are a few points I'd like to discuss further.

1. **Formula Appropriateness**: The formula you presented indeed captures the essence of bond pricing accurately. It's an effective way to calculate present value considering both the coupon payments and the face value. 

2. **Calculation Steps**:  
   - The way you approached computing the present value of both the coupon payments and the face value is correct. Every step you outlined makes sense.

3. **Final Price Calculation**: 
   - Your final result of approximately $97.33 is consistent. However, I noticed some slight differences in how I calculated the individual present values, mainly due to rounding differences. I arrived at approximately $97.31, which can lead to rounding variations during intermediate steps.

4. **Choice of Correct Answer**:  
   - You indicated that the answer is (D), which is correct based on your calculations. However, I calculated a slight variance leading to a result that is still pretty close, but it remains within your answer. 

Overall, I do agree with your conclusion that the price of the bond is approximately $97.33 based on your steps. However, I believe that my use of more granular calculations could help address any discrepancies in practices that may occur.

I'm open to continuing this discussion if you want to delve deeper into any specific part of the calculations or the bond pricing concept in general! 

So, I would say I DISAGREE with certain minor nuances in our calculated values but would like to continue discussing these to ensure clarity and accuracy.

[//]: # (2024-11-17 21:02:27)
You've raised some excellent points, and I appreciate your thorough review of my calculations.  You're right, the slight discrepancies in our final answers stem from rounding differences during the intermediate steps.  My approach used a slightly less precise rounding in the intermediate calculations, leading to a marginally different final answer. Your more granular approach is commendable for its accuracy.  The difference is minimal (a few cents) and doesn't affect the overall conclusion – option D remains the closest and most accurate answer given the choices provided.  My initial calculation was less precise in its intermediate steps, hence the slightly different final value.

I agree that using a higher precision during the intermediate steps, as you did, is a better practice to minimize rounding errors.  That reduces the chance of the final answer being further off the mark.


Therefore, I AGREE with your points and the discussion can be concluded.

To determine the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupons, and a yield of 6%, we can analyze the present value of its future cash flows. 

1. **Coupon Payment**: The annual coupon payment is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Coupon Payment} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Coupon Rate} = 100 \times 0.05 = 5 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Total Cash Flows**: This bond makes three annual coupon payments of $5 each and repays the face value of $100 at the end of year three.

3. **Present Value Calculation**: The present value of the cash flows can be found using the formula:
   \[
   PV = C * \left( \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \right) + \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
   \]
   Where \(C\) is the coupon payment, \(r\) is the yield, \(n\) is the number of years, and \(FV\) is the face value.

   Specifically:
   - \(C = 5\)
   - \(r = 0.06\)
   - \(n = 3\)
   - \(FV = 100\)

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   PV = 5 * \left( \frac{1 - (1 + 0.06)^{-3}}{0.06} \right) + \frac{100}{(1 + 0.06)^3}
   \]
   
   Calculating step by step:
   - Present value of coupon payments: 
     \[
     5 * \left( \frac{1 - (1.191016)^{-1}}{0.06} \right) \approx 13.37
     \]
   - Present value of the face value:
     \[
     \frac{100}{1.191016} \approx 83.96
     \]
   - Total Present Value:
     \[
     13.37 + 83.96 \approx 97.33
     \]

From the analysis above, the estimated price of the bond is approximately $97.33.

Thus, the most accurate response from the provided options is:

The answer is (D).

Let's think step by step.  To find the price of the bond, we need to calculate the present value of its future cash flows.  The bond has a face value of $100, a 5% coupon rate (resulting in annual coupon payments of $5), and a 6% yield to maturity.  The bond's term is 3 years.

The present value (PV) of a bond can be calculated using the following formula:

PV = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r + FV / (1 + r)^n

Where:

* PV = Present Value (price of the bond)
* C = Annual coupon payment ($5)
* r = Yield to maturity per period (0.06)
* n = Number of periods (3 years)
* FV = Face value ($100)

Plugging in the values:

PV = $5 * [1 - (1 + 0.06)^-3] / 0.06 + $100 / (1 + 0.06)^3

Calculating step-by-step, while minimizing rounding errors in intermediate calculations, leads to a present value of approximately $97.33.

The answer is (D).
