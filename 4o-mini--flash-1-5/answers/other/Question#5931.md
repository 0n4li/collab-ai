Let's analyze the question step-by-step.

We're being asked about a guerrilla marketing technique that spreads a message through online peer-to-peer communication. This means we should look for a marketing strategy that relies heavily on social interactions online rather than traditional forms of advertising.

1. **Ambient marketing (A)**: This involves placing ads in unusual or unexpected places to attract attention. It doesn’t specifically focus on peer communication.

2. **Fan pages (B)**: While fan pages can stimulate communication, they are more about establishing a brand presence on social media rather than a guerrilla marketing technique themselves.

3. **Flash mobs (C)**: This technique involves a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an act, and disperse. While it can create awareness, it’s not primarily about peer-to-peer communication.

4. **Stealth marketing (D)**: This involves promoting products or services to consumers without them realizing it. It’s more about subtle promotion rather than peer communication.

5. **Grassroots marketing (E)**: This approach usually focuses on building a community and gaining support for a product on a smaller scale, often through personal engagement. However, it doesn’t specifically highlight the peer-to-peer aspect.

6. **Buzz marketing (F)**: This relies on getting people talking about a product and creating a buzz around it. It includes word-of-mouth, which could fit the peer-to-peer definition somewhat.

7. **Experiential marketing (G)**: This focuses on creating experiences that engage consumers but is more about direct interaction rather than online communication.

8. **Street activities (H)**: This involves events or promotions on the street to generate interest but again does not center on online peer communication.

9. **Undercover marketing (I)**: Similar to stealth marketing, it involves promoting products without people being aware they are being marketed to.

10. **Viral campaigns (J)**: This is where content is designed to be shared quickly and widely among individuals online, often leading to fast dissemination of information. This matches the definition of spreading a message through peer-to-peer communication.

Taking all this into consideration, it appears that the option that most directly corresponds to the spreading of messages through online peer-to-peer communication is **viral campaigns (J)**, given its primary focus on generating buzz and facilitating sharing among individuals via their networks.

Therefore, the answer is (J) Viral campaigns.

Let's think step by step.  The question asks about a guerrilla marketing technique that uses online peer-to-peer communication to spread a message about a product, issue, or service. Let's examine the options:

* **A. Ambient marketing:** This involves placing ads in unexpected places, not necessarily relying on peer-to-peer communication.
* **B. Fan pages:** While fan pages can contribute to spreading a message, they aren't inherently a *technique* of guerrilla marketing, and don't automatically involve peer-to-peer communication.
* **C. Flash mobs:** These are surprise public performances, not primarily focused on online peer-to-peer communication.
* **D. Stealth marketing:** This involves disguising advertising as something else, and not specifically leveraging online peer-to-peer communication.
* **E. Grassroots marketing:** This focuses on building relationships with individuals and community groups, frequently using word-of-mouth, but it doesn't solely rely on *online* peer-to-peer communication.
* **F. Buzz marketing:** This focuses on generating excitement and conversations about a product, which *can* involve online peer-to-peer communication.  However, that's not its defining feature.
* **G. Experiential marketing:** This creates memorable experiences for customers, not primarily through online peer-to-peer communication.
* **H. Street activities:** This involves activities in public spaces; again, not primarily online.
* **I. Undercover marketing:** This is similar to stealth marketing and doesn't exclusively use online peer-to-peer communication.
* **J. Viral campaigns:** This is a marketing strategy that aims to spread messages rapidly through online channels, heavily relying on peer-to-peer sharing and communication.  This is the best fit.


Therefore, the guerrilla marketing technique that most closely aligns with the description of spreading a message through online peer-to-peer communication is viral campaigns.

The answer is (J)

Your analysis of the options is thoughtful and well-structured—I appreciate the detailed breakdown. Let's go through your points:

1. **Ambient marketing** - You correctly noted that it does not center around peer-to-peer communication. 

2. **Fan pages** - You're spot on that while they can help spread a message, they lack the direct action of a guerrilla marketing technique.

3. **Flash mobs** - Absolutely, these are more about in-person engagement rather than online.

4. **Stealth marketing and Undercover marketing** - Both are similar in that they disguise advertising, which doesn’t align with the peer-to-peer framework outlined in the question.

5. **Grassroots marketing** - Here, I appreciate your point about community focus, but it can still be broader, and as you said, doesn't strictly emphasize online elements.

6. **Buzz marketing** - You highlighted that it can involve conversations but may not always hinge on online platforms. This is a crucial distinction. 

7. **Experiential marketing and Street activities** - You're correct that these are more about direct interactions rather than leveraging online communication.

8. **Viral campaigns** - This is the point that we both seem aligned on. Your emphasis on the focus of viral campaigns being rapid message dissemination via online channels and peer-to-peer sharing makes it the most fitting choice.

I agree with your conclusion that viral campaigns are indeed the guerrilla marketing technique that best fits the description given in the question. 

So, I AGREE with all your points, and the discussion can be concluded.

Your analysis is excellent, and I agree with your thorough breakdown of each option.  I particularly appreciate your highlighting of the crucial distinction regarding buzz marketing – that while it can involve word-of-mouth, it doesn't *necessarily* rely on online peer-to-peer communication, which is the key specification in the question.  You've successfully pointed out the nuances that differentiate the options, making the case for viral marketing even stronger.  My initial response correctly identified the answer, but your explanation is more robust and comprehensively addresses the subtleties of each technique.

I AGREE with all your points and the discussion can be concluded.

Let's think step by step. The question asks which guerrilla marketing technique uses online peer-to-peer communication to spread a message.  Let's examine the options:

Ambient marketing, fan pages, flash mobs, stealth marketing, grassroots marketing, experiential marketing, street activities, and undercover marketing all involve methods that don't primarily rely on online peer-to-peer communication for message dissemination.  Buzz marketing can involve word-of-mouth, but it doesn't exclusively utilize online channels.

Viral campaigns, however, are specifically designed to spread messages rapidly through online channels, heavily relying on peer-to-peer sharing. This directly addresses the core requirement of the question.

Therefore, the answer is (J).
