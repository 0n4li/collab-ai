The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about law:

Question 1: What is the judge ad hoc?

Options: 
A. Judge ad hoc is the president of the ICJ
B. Judge ad hoc is a temporary judge appointed for a specific period of time
C. Judge ad hoc is the judge that each party will always nominate in every contentious case
D. Judge ad hoc is the member of the bench of the ICJ with a casting vote
E. Judge ad hoc is a judge who is nominated by the parties involved in a contentious case, irrespective of their nationality
F. Judge ad hoc is a judge who decides on the admissibility of cases before the ICJ
G. Judge ad hoc is a judge appointed by the Security Council of the United Nations
H. Judge ad hoc is a surrogate judge, in case a judge is disqualified or passes away
I. If a party to a contentious case before the ICJ does not have a national sitting as judge, it is entitled to nominate someone as a judge solely for that case, with the title of judge ad hoc

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on international law for help. As "ad hoc" implies, a judge ad hoc is appointed only for a specific case or period, when a party to a contentious case before the International Court of Justice does not have a regular national sitting as judge. The answer is (I).

Question 2: Functions of the law include all but which of the following?

Options: 
A. defining the limits of government power
B. regulating the use of public spaces
C. keeping the peace
D. maximizing individual freedom
E. maintaining order and stability
F. preventing environmental degradation
G. providing a basis for compromise
H. promoting social justice
I. promoting the principles of the free enterprise system
J. encouraging economic growth

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for help. Laws are fundamentally about helping resolve disputes between individuals, and therefore essential for maximizing individual freedom, providing a basis for compromise, and keeping the peace. The answer is (I).

Question 3: The ________ School of jurisprudence postulates that the law is based on what is "correct."

Options: 
A. Legal Pragmatism
B. Legal Formalism
C. Comparative
D. Analytical
E. Sociological
F. Historical
G. Critical Legal Studies
H. Realist
I. Positivist
J. Natural Law

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for help. Natural Law School of jurisprudence focuses on the laws of nature, and states that the law should be based on ethics, morals, and what is "correct". Analytical deals with the law as it already exists, Historical postulates that the law was found and not made, and Sociological studies how the law and society impact each other. The answer is (J).

Question 4: Which word best summarizes Weber's explanation of the development of formally rational law?

Options: 
A. Socialism.
B. Legitimacy.
C. Authority.
D. Democracy.
E. Bureaucracy.
F. Conflict.
G. Capitalism.
H. Charisma.
I. Co-operation.
J. Tradition.

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for help. Weber explained the development of formal rationality in laws as how the modern society moved from tradition to rationality, where people decide actions based less on how they were culturally done and more on expected utilities. How rational individuals optimize efficiency of accomplishing tasks for higher rewards is a core principle of Capitalism. The answer is (G).

Question 5: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?

Options: 
A. The second amendment - the right to bear arms.
B. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C. The tenth amendment - powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.
D. The first amendment - freedom of speech.
E. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.
F. The commerce clause.
G. The sixth amendment - right to a fair trial.
H. The eighth amendment - prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.
I. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (F).

## User Question


[//]: # (2024-11-24 01:25:26)
Question 6: In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for

Options: 
A. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
B. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
C. the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.
D. the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.

Answer 6: Let's think step by step.

ANALYSIS:
To accurately analyze the situation involving the dairy farm and the various conveyances and mortgages, we need to break down the facts presented and examine each option thoroughly. 

**Understanding the Recording and Covenants:**
1. We have general warranty deeds involved, which provide certain covenants to the grantee (the buyer) regarding the title of the property. The significant covenants typically included are:
   - Covenant of Seisin: The grantor has the legal right to convey the property.
   - Covenant of the Right to Convey: The grantor is legally entitled to transfer the property.
   - Covenant against Encumbrances: The property is free from any encumbrances (liens, mortgages, or other issues).

**Specific Facts to Consider:**
- The son conveyed the property in 1938 to his friend, but the mortgage in 1936 took precedence because it was recorded. In a notice-type jurisdiction, this means subsequent purchasers should be able to rely on the recorded interests, assuming they conduct a proper title search.
  
- The farmer bought the property from the friend in 1979, and his deed did not mention any mortgages, leading to the assumption that the property was free from encumbrances.

- The buyer entered into a contract with the farmer to purchase the property, concluding on January 15, 2009. After taking possession, the buyer discovers the unfulfilled mortgage from 1936.

Now, let’s evaluate each option based on our understanding of the covenants.

**Option Evaluations:**
A. The buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
- This option seems strong because the buyer has a right to expect the property free from encumbrances based on the covenant against encumbrances in his deed. However, since the mortgage was recorded prior to his acquisition and follows a title theory, this complicates things. 

B. The buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
- Valid reasoning here suggests that if the encumbrance exists at the time of conveyance, it does indeed constitute a breach, and the buyer may have a claim. 

C. The farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.
- This reasoning inaccurately reflects the concept of the covenant against encumbrances. The existence of the 1936 mortgage does support the argument that a breach occurs not just at the time of the conveyance but can also arise later when the buyer actually takes possession.

D. The farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.
- While it’s true that traditionally a breach is often linked to actual disturbance, the existence of the mortgage itself may constitute a breach regardless of whether the buyer experiences a disturbance in enjoyment of the land.

**Conclusion on the Best Option:**
- The strongest argument appears to lie with option B, as it acknowledges that the existence of a mortgage at the time of delivery constitutes a breach, entitling the buyer to monetary damages for that breach.

Thus, after thoroughly evaluating the facts and the options:

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (B).

ANALYSIS:

This question presents a scenario involving a chain of title to a dairy farm and subsequent breach of covenant claims. To determine the correct answer, we must analyze each option step-by-step, considering the relevant legal principles of recording statutes, title theory mortgages, and covenants of title.

**Question Interpretation:** The core issue is whether the farmer is liable to the buyer for breach of the covenant against encumbrances due to the outstanding 1936 mortgage.  The question hinges on the timing of the breach and the nature of the covenant. The jurisdiction uses a notice-type recording statute, meaning that a subsequent purchaser is only bound by prior interests of which they had actual or constructive notice.  It also follows a title theory of mortgages, meaning that the mortgagee holds legal title to the property until the mortgage is satisfied.

**Evaluation of Options:**

* **A. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.** This statement is partially correct. A covenant against encumbrances guarantees that the property is free from encumbrances *at the time of conveyance*. However, this option doesn't address the crucial timing element of the breach.  The 1936 mortgage predates the farmer's acquisition of the property. The buyer's claim hinges upon whether the farmer's covenant was breached at the time of the 2009 conveyance.

* **B. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.** This option is also partially correct in stating that the buyer (covenantee) would be entitled to damages if the covenant was breached.  However, similar to option A, it doesn't fully address the critical question of *when* the breach occurred. The delivery of the deed in 2009 only transfers the breach to the buyer; it doesn't establish that a breach occurred at that time.

* **C. the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.** This option correctly identifies the crucial timing element of breach with respect to the covenant against encumbrances.  A covenant against encumbrances is breached at the time of conveyance if an encumbrance exists at that time.  Since the 1936 mortgage existed prior to the farmer's acquisition, he did not breach this covenant when he conveyed the property in 2009 in this scenario.

* **D. the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.** This option introduces the concept of actual disturbance, which is a requirement for breach of a covenant against encumbrances in many jurisdictions. Although this could potentially be true, this answer option neglects to address the primary issue of the underlying 1936 mortgage.  It doesn't directly address whether the covenant was breached at the time of conveyance.


**Key Considerations and Reasoning Steps:**

1. **Notice-type Recording Statute:**  The buyer had constructive notice of the 1936 mortgage due to it being recorded.   This notice doesn't affect the farmer's covenant, but it's contextually important.

2. **Title Theory Mortgage:** The 1936 mortgage created an encumbrance on the property. The fact that the bank later took a mortgage subordinate to this one changes nothing in this context. This existing mortgage was a prior encumbrance.

3. **Covenant Against Encumbrances:**  This covenant guarantees the property is free from encumbrances at the *time of conveyance*. The farmer did not create the encumbrance; it existed before he acquired the property. There was no breach *at the time he conveyed the property*.

**Supporting Evidence/logic:** The crucial point is the timing of the breach.  The farmer's conveyance in 2009 did not create the encumbrance. The encumbrance predated his ownership.  Therefore, the covenant was not breached at the time he gave the warranty deed.


CONCLUSION:
The answer is (C)

ANALYSIS:

Thank you for your detailed perspective on the legal issue surrounding the dairy farm's ownership and the covenants involved. Your explanation effectively highlights important aspects related to the notice-type recording statute, title theory mortgages, and covenants of title, particularly focusing on the timing of the breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

**Addressing Key Points:**
1. **Covenant Timing:** I agree with your emphasis on the timing of the breach. The covenant against encumbrances indeed guarantees that the property is free from any pre-existing encumbrances at the time of conveyance. You rightly point out that the farmer did not create the encumbrance; it existed prior to his ownership.

2. **Notice-type Recording Statute:** Your point about the notice-type statute and the buyer's constructive notice of the 1936 mortgage is crucial. It reinforces that the buyer should have been aware of existing encumbrances due to the mortgage being recorded, which can impact the weight of any claims against the farmer.

3. **Encumbrance Determination:** Your evaluation of each option is strong. You clarify that while the buyer does have certain rights under the general warranty deed, the mortgage’s existence does not amount to a breach of covenant by the farmer since it was pre-existing and not created by him at the time of conveyance.

**Covenant Against Encumbrances:** 
- I would emphasize that for a breach to occur under the covenant against encumbrances, the encumbrance must be something that the grantor added or failed to disclose. Here, since the 1936 mortgage preceded the farmer's ownership, his conveyance in 2009 does not trigger liability for breach against the buyer.

However, I would like to discuss and challenge your emphasis on the ideas discussed in option **D**. While you stated that it introduces the concept of actual disturbance, it’s essential to note that many jurisdictions interpret that a breach of covenant against encumbrances can occur regardless of whether actual disturbance (such as foreclosure) has happened, provided that a prior unfulfilled mortgage exists.

Overall, I find your reasoning compelling, particularly regarding the conclusion that the farmer did not breach any of the covenants due to the prior existence of the mortgage. 

CONCLUSION:
I AGREE with your analysis and conclude that the answer is (C).

[//]: # (2024-11-24 01:25:50)
You raise some excellent points, particularly concerning the nuances of the covenant against encumbrances and the potential for a breach even without actual disturbance.  I appreciate your thorough review and insightful critique of my previous response.  My initial focus on option B stemmed from a slightly narrower interpretation of the covenant against encumbrances, focusing primarily on the moment of conveyance. My reasoning, while not entirely incorrect, lacked the crucial detail you highlighted: the *source* of the encumbrance.

You correctly point out that the covenant against encumbrances protects against encumbrances created *by* the grantor or that should have been disclosed by the grantor. The 1936 mortgage existed long before the farmer acquired the property; it wasn't an encumbrance he created or failed to disclose.  This critical distinction renders option B less compelling than option C.  The farmer's covenant was not breached at the time of conveyance because the existing encumbrance was not of his making.

Option D, which involves "actual disturbance," introduces an additional element. While some jurisdictions require actual disturbance for a breach of covenant against encumbrances, many others recognize that the existence of the encumbrance itself, at the time of conveyance, constitutes a breach. However, as you correctly pointed out that is not the case here.

Your argument that the focus should be on the *source* of the encumbrance is compelling and clarifies the situation significantly.  The buyer's recourse (if any) would lie against those responsible for the 1936 mortgage, not the farmer who conveyed the property subject to an already existing encumbrance.

CONCLUSION:
I AGREE with your points and concede that option C is the most accurate answer. My previous conclusion was flawed in its narrow interpretation of the covenant against encumbrances.  The emphasis on the *source* of the encumbrance is crucial for determining liability. The updated answer is (C).

ANALYSIS:

I appreciate your thorough revisit of the analysis and your insightful feedback regarding the covenant against encumbrances. Your points shed important light on the nuances of liability connected to existing encumbrances and the primary source of these encumbrances.

**Key Clarifications and Validation:**
1. **Source of the Encumbrance:** You made a critical observation regarding the source of the encumbrance. It is indeed essential to recognize that the 1936 mortgage was not created by the farmer. The covenant against encumbrances is established to protect the grantee from encumbrances created by the grantor. This fundamental principle is key in clarifying why the covenant was not breached in this case.

2. **Interpretation of Options:** Option B indeed reflects a misunderstanding of the covenant's nature. Your clarification aligns with the correct understanding that liability should not arise for encumbrances that were not created by the covenantee. 

3. **Actual Disturbance in Option D:** You acknowledged the importance of this option but reinforced the potential misinterpretation in its application. While actual disturbance is a factor in determining damages in some jurisdictions, it does not diminish the primary issue here: the pre-existing encumbrance by the 1936 mortgage.

4. **Recourse for the Buyer:** You correctly stated that the buyer's potential claims would be directed towards the original holder responsible for the 1936 mortgage if they had valid grounds for addressing that particular obligation.

Your critique and subsequent arguments are well-founded. I appreciate the clarity you've brought to the discussion, particularly the importance of focusing on the source of encumbrances when evaluating breaches of covenant against encumbrances.

CONCLUSION:
I AGREE with your points, especially concerning the interpretation of the covenant against encumbrances and the priorities it sets on liability based on the source of encumbrance. The updated answer is (C).

I agree entirely with your assessment.  Your summary perfectly encapsulates the key points of the analysis and correctly identifies the flaw in my initial reasoning.  The focus on the *source* of the encumbrance is the linchpin in understanding why the farmer is not liable for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.  The 1936 mortgage, pre-existing his ownership, is not something he created or should have disclosed.  Therefore, his covenant against encumbrances remained unbroken at the time of conveyance to the buyer.

Your detailed explanation of the options and the nuanced understanding of the covenant's application solidify our shared conclusion. There's nothing further to add from my perspective.

CONCLUSION:
I AGREE with all your points and we can conclude the discussion. The final answer remains (C).

Things learned from the discussion:
- The source of the encumbrance is critical when evaluating breaches of the covenant against encumbrances. An encumbrance that predates the grantor’s ownership cannot lead to a breach of the covenant.
- The necessity of understanding the distinction between encumbrances created by the grantor versus those that are pre-existing when determining liability under a warranty deed.
  
Things reaffirmed from the discussion:
- The covenant against encumbrances guarantees that the property is free from any encumbrances that the grantor has created or should have disclosed.
- While actual disturbance of possession is relevant in some contexts, the mere existence of a pre-existing encumbrance at the time of conveyance is sufficient to establish a breach.

Things still not clear from the discussion:
- The extent to which the jurisdiction's application of a notice-type recording statute might affect future claims against interested parties. It may be worth further elaborating on how this could affect liability for subsequent purchasers.

Revised response:
The answer is (C) because the farmer did not create the 1936 mortgage; it was a pre-existing encumbrance that existed before his ownership. Therefore, when the farmer conveyed the property in 2009, he did not breach the covenant against encumbrances, as the encumbrance was not of his doing.

Things learned from the discussion:

* The crucial importance of identifying the *source* of an encumbrance when analyzing a breach of covenant against encumbrances.  Liability only arises for encumbrances created by the grantor or that they should have disclosed. Pre-existing encumbrances do not trigger such liability.
* The necessity of a nuanced understanding of the covenant against encumbrances, going beyond simply the timing of conveyance to consider the origin and nature of the encumbrance.
* While the concept of "actual disturbance" is relevant in some jurisdictions concerning the breach of covenant against encumbrances, it does not negate the primary issue of the pre-existing encumbrance in this scenario.


Things reaffirmed from the discussion:

* The relevance of a notice-type recording statute in establishing constructive notice for subsequent purchasers.
* The application of the title theory of mortgages in defining ownership and potential encumbrances.
* The importance of carefully evaluating all options provided in a multiple-choice question, even if initially one appears compelling.


Things still not clear from the discussion:

* The specific jurisdictional rules regarding damages for breach of covenant against encumbrances in cases where actual disturbance is not present. While we determined there was no breach, the question of damages if the farmer had indeed breached the covenant warrants further consideration depending on the jurisdiction's specific legal framework.


Revised response:

ANALYSIS:

The question involves a complex chain of title with multiple conveyances and mortgages, focusing on a breach of covenant against encumbrances.  To answer accurately, we must understand the principles of recording statutes, title theory mortgages, and covenants of title.  Crucially, the analysis needs to emphasize the *source* of the encumbrance.

The key facts are: (1) a 1936 mortgage exists prior to any conveyance pertinent to the farmer; (2) the jurisdiction employs a notice-type recording statute, providing constructive notice to subsequent purchasers; (3) the jurisdiction follows a title theory of mortgages.  The farmer's conveyance (in 1979 and again in 2009) does not create the 1936 mortgage encumbrance.  The covenant against encumbrances only protects against encumbrances created by, or known to, the grantor.

**Evaluation of Options:**

A. Incorrect. While the covenant guarantees freedom from encumbrances, the grantor isn't liable for pre-existing ones.
B. Incorrect.  A breach of the covenant against encumbrances needs to be established *at the time of conveyance* by the grantor.  The 1936 encumbrance predates this.
C. Correct. The covenant against encumbrances is only breached if an encumbrance exists at the time of the conveyance and is a result of the grantor's actions or inaction. The 1936 mortgage was pre-existing, therefore, there is no breach.
D. Incorrect.  While actual disturbance is a factor in some jurisdictions, it is not the primary determining factor in this case, particularly since there is no breach.


CONCLUSION:
The answer is (C)

ANALYSIS:
To address the question about the dairy farm's ownership and the covenants involved, it is crucial to break down the details thoroughly. This scenario involves multiple conveyances and distinctions related to covenants of title, particularly focusing on the covenant against encumbrances.

1. **Understanding the Covenants:**
   - The general warranty deed provides several covenants to the grantee (the buyer), one of which is the covenant against encumbrances. This covenant guarantees that the property is free from any outstanding claims, liens, or interests that were created by the grantor.

2. **Key Facts:**
   - The property was mortgaged before the farmer acquired it.
   - The farmer conveyed the property to the buyer, but the outstanding 1936 mortgage existed prior to the farmer's ownership.
   - The buyer discovers this mortgage after taking possession and seeks damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

3. **Evaluating Options:**
   - **Option A:** Suggests the buyer's right to damages based on the covenant against encumbrances being a guarantee against outstanding interests. This is correct conceptually but fails to address the timing and source of the encumbrance.
   - **Option B:** Indicates that the covenant is breached at the time the deed is delivered, which aligns with the notion of liability but overlooks that the mortgage existed prior to the conveyance by the farmer.
   - **Option C:** States that the farmer is not liable because the covenant can only be breached if an encumbrance exists at the time of conveyance. This accurately reflects that the 1936 mortgage was not created by the farmer and therefore does not constitute a breach of the covenant against encumbrances.
   - **Option D:** Argues for the farmer's defense unless there was actual disturbance, which is less relevant as a breach can occur regardless of disturbance if there is a pre-existing encumbrance.

4. **Conclusion on the Best Option:**
   - The strongest argument is found in option C. The 1936 mortgage predates the farmer's ownership and is therefore not a breach of covenant against encumbrances when the farmer conveyed the property.

FINAL CONCLUSIVE RESPONSE:
The answer is (C) because the farmer did not create the 1936 mortgage; it was a pre-existing encumbrance that existed before his ownership. Therefore, when the farmer conveyed the property in 2009, he did not breach the covenant against encumbrances, as the encumbrance was not of his doing.

ANALYSIS:

This question presents a scenario involving a chain of title to a dairy farm and a subsequent claim for breach of covenant.  The core issue is whether the farmer (the grantor in 2009) is liable to the buyer (the grantee in 2009) for breach of the covenant against encumbrances due to an outstanding mortgage recorded in 1936.  The jurisdiction uses a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages.

The crucial element is the timing and origin of the encumbrance (the 1936 mortgage).  The covenant against encumbrances protects against encumbrances existing at the time of conveyance *that are the responsibility of the grantor*.  The 1936 mortgage predates the farmer's acquisition of the property.  Therefore, the farmer did not create this encumbrance.

**Evaluation of Options:**

A. Incorrect. This option correctly describes the general purpose of the covenant against encumbrances, but it fails to consider the crucial element of the grantor's responsibility for the encumbrance.

B. Incorrect.  While the buyer would be entitled to damages if the covenant *were* breached, the key is whether the farmer breached it. The 1936 mortgage pre-exists the farmer's ownership.  A breach of this covenant occurs at the time of conveyance if an encumbrance exists *at that time and is attributable to the grantor*. This is not the case here.

C. Correct.  This option correctly identifies the crucial issue of *when* the breach, if any, occurred.  The covenant against encumbrances is breached ONLY at the time of conveyance if the encumbrance exists at that time and is the responsibility of the grantor. Since the 1936 mortgage predates the farmer's ownership, and therefore the 2009 conveyance from the farmer to the buyer, the farmer did not breach the covenant.

D. Incorrect. Although actual disturbance can play a role in some jurisdictions' determination of damages in a breach of covenant against encumbrances, it is not the central consideration, especially in the absence of a breach. 

CONCLUSION:
The answer is (C)
