The following are example multiple choice questions (with answers) about math:

Question 1: The symmetric group $S_n$ has $
\factorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.
Find the characteristic of the ring 2Z.

Options: A. 0
B. 30
C. 3
D. 10
E. 12
F. 50
G. 2
H. 100
I. 20
J. 5

Answer 1: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).

Question 2: Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?

Options: A. ST + TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
B. TS = 0
C. ST = 1
D. ST - TS = 0
E. ST = T
F. ST = 0
G. ST = TS
H. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
I. TS = T
J. ST = S

Answer 2: Let's think step by step. For a given polynomial $p$ we have
\[ST(p) = (xp(x))’ = p(x) + xp’(x)\]
and
\[TS(p) = xp’(x).\]
Hence \[ST(p) - TS(p) = p(x) + xp’(x) - xp’(x).\] The answer is (H).

Question 3: Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \in A}?

Options: A. -5
B. 0
C. -3
D. -7
E. -4
F. -6
G. -1
H. -2
I. -9

Answer 3: Let's think step by step. We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$. The answer is (E).

Question 4: A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?

Options: A. 3 + e^-2
B. 2 - e^-4
C. 2 - e^-2
D. 3 + e^-4
E. 2 + e^-3
F. 2 - e^-3
G. 3 - e^-2
H. 2 + e^-2
I. 2 + e^-4
J. 2

Answer 4: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$
\frac{d}{d t}[\ln (s-2)]=\frac{s^{\prime}}{s-2}=\frac{-1}{25}=\frac{d}{d t}\left[-\frac{t}{25}ight] .
$$
Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$. The answer is (I).

Question 5: A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?

Options: A. Multiply 5 by 5 to find 25 teams.
B. Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.
C. Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.
D. Subtract 30 from 5 to find -25 teams.
E. Divide 5 by 30 to find 0.1667 teams.
F. Add 5 to 30 then divide by 2 to find 17.5 teams.

Answer 5: Let's think step by step. We want to find the number of teams. We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players. Thus to get the number of teams we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6 teams. The answer is (B).

To address the question, we need to convert the written amount "six thousand forty-nine dollars" into its numeral form. 

Step 1: Break down the written amount:
- "Six thousand" equals 6,000.
- "Forty-nine" equals 49.

Step 2: Combine these two parts:
To write "six thousand forty-nine" as a numeral, we add the two values together:
- 6,000 + 49 = 6,049.

Step 3: Now, let's look through the provided options to find a match for our calculation:
- A. $6049
- B. $604.9
- C. $6,490 
- D. $6,940
- E. $6,409 
- F. $9,406
- G. $6,049 
- H. $649 
- I. $60,490
- J. $4,069

From the calculations and the breakdown, we see that the correct numeral for the price Manuel paid is $6,049.

Thus, the answer to the question is:
The answer is (G).

Let's think step by step. The question asks for the numerical representation of "six thousand forty-nine dollars".  We break down the number into its components:

* **Six thousand:** This represents 6,000.
* **Forty-nine:** This represents 49.

Combining these, we get 6,000 + 49 = 6,049.  Therefore, the cost of the used car is $6,049.

The answer is (G)
